You have to share the appartment with Marian so pay attention and don't be too loud in the evening!!\r\ndisadvantage: the heat is terrible in summer and there is no air-condition..\r\n\r\nI would overall recommend it to everybody!!

Muchos puertorique\u00f1os y Dominicanos, as\u00ed que nos sentimos como en casa. Todo fue muy c\u00f3modo y limpio. Los vecinos hicieron mucho ruido en las noches, pero no fue problema para nosotros. Una sugerencia ser\u00eda poner un espejo de cuerpo completo en alguna parte del apartento. En resumen, el apartamento fue perfecto para nosotros, nos volver\u00edamos a quedar y claro que lo recomendar\u00eda! Muchas Gracias Kevin por tu ayuda!"

It is just a short 5-min walk from the subway station, so very convenient. Street noise is not a problem although you can hear the neighbors at times (the kids next door can be noisy). East Harlem is a bustling Latino neighborhood with many local eateries and shops. The food selection is supposed to be great (too bad we didn't get to try any). There is a grocery store right outside the building. There're always locals hanging out in front but we were never bothered. All and all, a good choice if you are looking to stay in this part of the city."

From the moment we booked Cynthia could not have been more helpful with everything and was always ready and willing to answer all of our queries. Cynthia provided us with an extensive list of recommendations for our stay on Maui and we were not disappointed. The condo is located in a quiet but convenient neighbourhood and close to many amenities. We found the condo extremely spacious and it accommodated our party of 3 adults and two teenaged children with no problem at all. Cynthia's condo is the penthouse and is set right on the beach so we were treated to gorgeous Hawaiian sunsets every night, as well as being able to see turtles and whales from our balcony. The condo is beautifully presented and very well equipped - we could not have asked for anything more for our nine day stay. \r\nMahalo Cynthia "

It was really easy to run up to the Condo for my 9-month old nap times or a quick snack, without being too separated from the family.  The onsite pools, restaurant and of course restaurant/bar became our home bases for the week.  Miso Phat Sushi (across the street) and Maui Brewing were awesome near-by/within walking distance restaurants.  My family and I can't stop bragging about our trip and what a wonderful family/group set-up this Condo is!  We recommend renting a car due to the distance from the airport, but the Condo/Resort has onsite parking."

The kitchen has everything you need, and the barbques downstairs were perfect for grilling.  Cynthia left us plenty of information for dining in the vicinity, so we had 3 nice dinners out. The guide she sent us before our visit was very informative and helped us to plan our outings while in Maui. Cynthia also checked in with us during our visit, making sure we had everything we needed. We are already planning a return visit to #391 at the Sands of Kahana in the near future!"

Cynthia is very quick to respond to communication and is clear as to what she can provide as a host, as well as her expectation of guests. She was as incredible as her Kahana home was and we'd highly recommend this place for anyone, including those with small children."

I have informed the householder at once. When we arrived at the airport, we could not find the driver waiting for us at the arrival with our name. Then, I tried to ask for the help from the householder to meet the driver at the airport. After almost one-hour waiting, we are refused by the driver to meet at the airport and He asked us to find his car at the park. How ridiculous! This service costs 20 euro each person but we cannot even have the right to be picked up. We were so angry and chose to take the taxi. At the same time, I texted the householder that we were tired of waiting for the driver and we were on the way to ur apartment by taxi.\n\nThe householder didn't tell me that I should phone another guy to tell him that we were on the way to the apartment until We arrived. What all she talked about were the money of the pick-up service. We spent another 45 minutes to wait for the guy to send the key. Again, when he came, he talked about the money. We asked for the service, but u did not provide it with us. How dare u to ask for the payment? Besides, do u know what? We are totally seven people, so this service should cost 140 euro totally. But two taxis only cost us 70 euro. The driver knows the guy and the householder. I doubt that they are on the business to play trick with me.\n\nBarcelona is a really nice city to travel, but this experience does make a bad impression on me. \n "

There is a park down the street and a supermarket directly across. Xavi met us on arrival and was very nice and helpful throughout our stay. When my husband accidentally left a few things in the apartment, Xavi collected them and met us upon our return to Barcelona a few days later to return them. Thanks, Xavi!

Before the trip, we were given immediate and friendly response from host and on the day of our arrival, she came to pick us up at the nearest bus stop, where we took a direct cityflyer bus from the Airport as per our host's guidance.\r\n\r\nApt was tidy, clean, cosy and comfortable for our three nights stay. Host even provided snacks/tidbits and several drink mix. There were bedroom slippers, electric kettle, microwave, cups, bowls and utensils, TV, basic toiletries and hairdryer. We were told that the temperature of the aircon could not be adjusted but that did not affect us at all because the temperature was just right throughout our stay during the rainy season period. \r\n\r\nWe were also given a precise mini tour of what was in the apt and how we could use the very convenient sofa bed (which we didn't use in the end because the third person did not stay with us). There's wifi in the apt as well. However, we did experience some connection issues with the TV on one night which we gave up after awhile when we couldn't watch the few channels we wanted to. \r\n\r\nIt's a very quiet building located extremely convenient to the MTR, just 2 minutes walk to the nearest exit (and probably another 5-8 mins walk before you reach the MTR gantry). Right across the building on the ground floor there are two popular cafes and one ice cream shop that I would highly recommend and they need no introduction, just (Hidden by Airbnb) it if you're a fellow cafehopper/dessert person. \r\n\r\nIt is also very near the k11 mall, an art mall that I loved a lot and even managed to check out the Urban Sense art exhibition for free! (Because we snapped a photo of the exhibition board and posted it on our social media accounts but thankfully we went in for free as there were nothing much in there and we were basically out in 15 minutes. But still, do check it out if you happen to be there and follow the instructions to get the free entrance!)\r\n\r\nAt the end of our stay, our host even surprised with a little gift - a box of Jenny Bakery cookies, which we really appreciated a lot :)\r\n\r\nOverall, it's a nice, cosy little apt for 2-3 pax accommodation in Hong Kong and definitely cheaper but value-for-money alternative compared to hotel stay. It was smaller than I had imagined since I have only stayed in hotel during all my trips to HK located on the Hong Kong island but truth be told, I wouldn't mind heading back to book my stay with Michelle&May, probably check out their other listings which are all also located on Kowloon :)"

Maui Vision became a reality and a business starting with my personal condo at the Kihei Akahi Resort C618.\r\n\r\nMaui Vision is a business I love because I get to share the Aloha Spirit, the beauty of the land, and talk story with people from around the world. It is nice to know that we can contribute to someone\u2019s Hawaiian vacation experience in a positive way. We love to hear back from our happy guests.\r\n\r\nI used to live on the island of Oahu with my US Navy family when I was young.  We later moved to Southern California.  I knew one day I would return to Hawaii, the place I fell in love with long ago. I took a leap of faith and purchased my Maui condo June 2002 this was the beginning of fulfilling her prophecy to once again return to Hawaii soil.\r\n\r\nI am a tropical expression artist who paints on canvas and etched metal.  My work is inspired by the beauty of the islands and has been displayed in several Maui art galleries over the years.  I am a writer and have my first book on Amazon.  I recently took up hula dancing and love to immerse myself in the culture and grace of this island.\r\n\r\nI have over 25 years of business administration and customer service experience working for large corporations and high tech startups.\r\n\r\nIf you are in need of a caring Realtor here on Maui, please contact Kathy McCartney RS#77317 of La Costa Realty Hawai\u2019i, LLC Brokerage Lic #18349 .",

The other 2 bedrooms are in the back and are quieter. You will hear the neighbors upstairs when they walk around, but this was not a problem at night.\r\n\r\nThe neighborhood is lively and has lots of restaurants. There is a supermarket 2 blocks away. Metro stops are a 10-15 minute walk. Parc Jeanne-Mance is a block away and great for an evening picnic.\r\n\r\nFlatbook was very responsive via phone and email (though email sometimes took several hours to be answered)."

The appliances were all new and the apartment in general was in great condition.  There are 4 separate bedrooms each with a desk, closet and drawers.  The apartment is in a great neighborhood with easy access to anything you want to do.  We LOVED the area and I enjoyed running in the nearby park daily.  The neighborhood is very safe and we all felt immediately \"at home.\" I cannot say enough about the customer service provided by Flatbook.  Upon check we had an issue with the lockbox.  Erika was over within 5 minutes to assist us.  She was kind, personable and professional.  We had a small issue with one the beds that had not been properly assembled.  We sent a message and within hours someone came and delivered a new bed. There was a minor issue with front door of the building as it appeared someone had broken a hinge. This didn't really compromise security but I let them know as I thought it would polite.  It was fixed before I saw it again.  I have stayed at hotels with maintenance teams on site that could not provide this level of customer service.  They truly deliver on their promise of 5 star 24 hour service.  I would be thrilled to have future booking accompanied with Flatbook service and can't wait to use them again!!!!"

Also two blocks away you have the E train that also goes into Manhattan and the G train that goes into Brooklyn.\r\n\r\nIn the area there's still a cozy and cheap diner that's open 24/7, a few stores to get supplies and a few other places of interest. Location was excellent, 10 minutes away from everything.\r\n\r\nThe room was great and packed with a mini fridge, coffee maker, TV, a sofa, full size bed and walk-in closet. There was also a private bathroom that had everything you needed and a very good shower.\r\n\r\nThere's also a garden out back where you can go outside in the mornings and just relax, eat breakfast, etc.\r\n\r\nOrestes was a great host and gave me a lot of good spots to go sightseeing. Good person to chat with and quite knowledgeable about the city.\r\n\r\nI think that for the price, you simply can't get any better."

There is also a lovely river walk about 15 minutes away which give you the most wonderful views of Manhattan, and there are loungers to relax on at the waters edge!\r\nThe house is absolutely beautiful (you can tell Orestes is an architect), you have your own front door and the room is plenty big enough (I stayed with a friend - she slept on the double futon which was very comfy). It also has air conditioning. The bathroom is stunning, with a huge steam room/shower, and it is not shared with anyone else. We were given plenty of fresh towels most days. Orestes' office is on the same floor and then the back garden is just lovely - a great place to sit and eat a takeaway or, as we did, sit and have breakfast.\r\nAs a host Orestes was faultless really! He was very friendly and helpful, and we enjoyed telling him about our day - he was happy to recommend places to see and to eat, but also totally respected our privacy and we felt would have probably left us totally to our own devices if we'd wanted. He also had a lovely little dog called Kiki!\r\nThere was no weird faff with deposits or cleaning fees, everything was simple and wonderful. I honestly can't wait to go back and I want to take all of my friends. Don't hesitate to stay here.\r\nThanks Orestes, it was fabulous x"

The facilities were fantastic and we enjoyed using the pool (which is also a lot bigger in person) which has stunning views over Rio, including Christ the Redeemer on Corcovado mountain. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and learnt our faces immediately so we had no problem at all gaining access to the very secure apartment (the staff buzz you in the gates via CCTV). The neighbourhood is more downtown Rio and if you like a good night out it will be perfect for you. We didn't feel that the neighbourhood was the safest of areas in Rio, but then again anywhere in Rio during the night isn't the safest place to be. The noise from the street at night was sometimes a little loud especially on Fridays and Saturdays which are extremely busy times in Lapa however we understand that this noise is unavoidable and inevitable. It must also be taken into consideration that we were in Rio for the busiest two weeks of the year, during the 2016 Olympics, a time when at night there were hundreds of thousands of tourists on the streets as well as the locals! Despite this as soon as we entered the double electronic gated apartment block we felt completely at ease and safe and during or time in Rio we spent one of the day's exploring Lapa, admiring its arches and the colourful artwork and graffiti that the locality had to offer. The apartment was perfect for us, size, location, accessibility were all excellent. Our neighbours were very friendly and helpful and would always say \"good morning\" and \"good evening\" in the elevator throughout the day. There was a very convenient supermarket just 1 minutes  walk from the apartment and the kitchen had everything you could possible need. If however you prefer to eat out, Lapa has many excellent bars and restaurants and so does Copacabana and Ipanena if you want to travel a little further away. The shower was particularly excellent-hot water was always in abundance. This apartment had everything we wanted and we couldn't have asked for a better place to stay during our time spent in Rio De Janeiro for the Olympics. If and when we ever return to Rio Dejanira's apartment is the only option for us and we would love to stay there again."

Here are the pros and cons of our experience with this rental: Pros: **Beach access within walking distance **Views **Kitchen well stocked with essentials **Clean and tidy **Beach towels provided (had to get them delivered since none were in the unit as expected, but they came quickly) Cons: **Beds are not comfortable **Pillows could use replacing - they are very flat **All closet doors were next to impossible to open ( this would not have been an issue had there been any sort of dresser with drawers in the master or if the dresser in the second room had drawers that opened, but there wasn't and they didn't, so we had to live out of our suitcases for the week) **We were told there were sand toys, but there weren't. There was snorkel gear and a lone bucket, but no sand toys. A bit of a bummer for the kids who wanted to build sand castles. Things you should know before booking: **this unit is NOT beachfront, it is shorefront. During our stay the water was out far enough at low tide that we could walk on the sand to the nearby beach, but at no point were you able to set up a blanket and play in the sand right in front of the unit. **pictures of the listing are \"doctored up\" for lack of a better term. All the decor is the same and it's definitely the same unit, but you can tell once you walk in that the images were softened and brightened to add listing appeal. Case in point - I showed my 11 year old the pictures of the listed before we took our trip and upon arrival his first words were \"this looks nothing like the photos.\" **that being said, our boys LOVED waking up in the morning when the tide was out and going exploring in the exposed reefs for fish and sea creatures - this is the most redeeming quality of this unit. We did this most mornings as they never tired of exploring, and one morning we even had a few Humuhumu fish shimming right around us when the water was only up to our knees. Very cool. **owner requires a $500 safety deposit that was not explained in the listing at the time we booked, we received a contract after the fact requesting this deposit and the taxes (also not made clear) so you think you're paying one total price, but you will need to pay more **you are not allowed to run the AC in the unit at night and leaving windows open to utilize cool air crosswinds is not an option as the birds outside the bedroom windows provide you with a 5am wake up call **we were checked out for 10 days with no sign of our security deposit being returned. I texted the owner several..."

Do not believe the other guest review... nothing was doctored up, the furniture was great, we used the AC whenever we wanted to.  There were plenty of sand toys, snorkel gear, etc.  There were no issues.  \n\nMy sister and I were on a quest to see as many turtles on Maui as possible and we saw more than 5 everyday right in front of the condo!  They come and feed on the reef between the hours of 10 am and 3 pm.  Much better than having to drag all of your stuff to the beach and then back.  My husband would be sitting outside on the patio enjoying his coffee and cigar, signal that there was a turtle, and we literally threw on our bathing suits, grabbed the snorkel gear and were in the water in a matter of seconds!  \n\nA total of 4 adults stayed at the condo for over a week and it was cozy but very comfortable.  The kitchen had everything that we needed.  We cooked breakfast, cut fruit from the farmers market, made smoothies; every kitchen tool we needed was there for us.  The beds were comfortable, there were curtains that we could shut to let some breeze in but still have privacy.  The newly done wood-like tile floors were a plus also.  \n\nWe had looked at many condos in this area and in the Kihei area and we are so glad we chose this one.  Francesco was also so easy to work with, always responded quickly when we had questions.  Could not have asked for a better host."

I teach middle school math at an international school here in Hong Kong and have enjoyed the lifestyle of living and working in this vibrant city. \r\n\r\nHong Kong has always had plenty of options to stay active. I've played in an expat softball league here for many years and still try to get out as much as I can. When I first arrived, I did a few of the popular hikes, but not so much anymore unfortunately. There are still some places in Hong Kong that I would like to explore and I also find the city to be a great hub for travelling throughout southeast Asia. \r\n\r\nI'm new to Airbnb and open to suggestions on making your stay in Hong Kong an enjoyable experience. Nice to meet you!",

If you once find this place, you will relalise how close it is from Soho, but getting here for the first time wasn't very easy for us. I stayed here with my husband and my brother's family and the place was spacious enough (considering its hongkong) for us all to hang around. You need to walk up to the 4th floor but wasn't a problme at all to us. \nWe had some issue about electricity but Melanie responded quickly and helped us sort out the problem. One thing we felt inconvenient was hot shower but we got used to it later. And, it was very considerate of Melanie to prepare three heaters for us. \nI highly recommend this place for a family or groups of 4-5 ppl and especially those who wish to enjoy the atmosphere of Soho area and lankwaifong. I and my husband went out for a drink every night and found awesome bars and restaurants. We could have done it easily as the place is so close to it. \n"

It has direct elevator access to the apartment above, so unloading and loading the car was very convenient.\n\nThe area around the apartment has stores, restaurants, a Mercadona Supermarket, and many smaller grocery stores. The sidewalks are broad and evenly graded which makes for easy walking, and clean.\n\nPublic buses are frequent and easy to use, and there is an underground Metro station nearby within easy walking distance.\n\nDavid was what I would call a super host. His apartment was well equipped with every modern convenience and very clean. It was also very well stocked with food; bread, milk, juice, fresh fruit, butter, coking oil, etc., including a bottle of wine.\n\nHe patiently and carefully explained the works of every appliance in the apartment, including the use of the television features, and he made sure you are aware that he is available for any question later on. Communicating in English was not a problem.\n\nWe greatly appreciated the considerable time he spent providing us with detailed explanation of all the major attractions of Barcelona and how to get there. His Guest Guidebook includes all the details one could possibly ever need while in Barcelona, from managing emergency situations, using public transport, maps, to restaurants, shops, museums and all major attractions. Our visit to Barcelona was made much easier because of the book, and we learned a lot more.\n\nWe would recommend anyone visiting Barcelona to use David's place. We will definitely return to David's apartment if we should want to visit Barcelona again. The five days we were there were not enough.\n"

It is no surprise that the owner has been awarded the Tripadvisor Certificate of Excellence.  \n\nDavid keeps in touch, checking in to see if/what there is anything we need, in addition to recommending places to visit.  It's not just lip service.  For example, we suggested he consider adding a mat in the bathtub, which could be a bit slippery.  Later that day, DONE.\n\nFor example, when it was was time to vacate after our ten-day stay, we asked if would do us the favour of arranging for a mini-van to pick us up at 5:30am, as we were taking a train on to San Sebastian, and couldn't risk any misunderstanding if we tried booking this ourselves.  After checking around, David came back with an answer.  The going rate was too high and he was still looking to find us much more reasonable transportation.  He DID.\n\nThis beautifully decorated, two-bedroom apartment is everything as described, well-equipped, well-stocked, clean and comfortable with a lovely balcony and close to all amenities.  \n\nDo we recommend it, most definitely YES."

Most of the things you'd like to do are within walking distance: a lot of cultural highlights, shopping, bus/metro/train and of course many Port-houses.\n\nThe apartment sits in a somewhat old building which is a contrast to the apartment itself. It has been nicely renovated and has the comfort you would want. It's spacious for a stay with two people. Most of the interior is new and functions properly. This is complemented by nice (and some antique) decorative details.\nA pleasant surprise was the smell of freshly baked bread every morning in the staircase. The downstairs neighbour is a bakery where you can get good and cheap bread and your morning espresso.\n\nWe have had contact with Teresa through AirBNB, she has been helpful and kind. Tim welcomed us with a gastronomic surprise and even a list of suggestions for our stay in Porto. They are a very hospitable and helpful couple!\n\nThank you Teresa and Tim!"

Maui Vision became a reality and a business starting with my personal condo at the Kihei Akahi Resort C618.\r\n\r\nMaui Vision is a business I love because I get to share the Aloha Spirit, the beauty of the land, and talk story with people from around the world. It is nice to know that we can contribute to someone\u2019s Hawaiian vacation experience in a positive way. We love to hear back from our happy guests.\r\n\r\nI used to live on the island of Oahu with my US Navy family when I was young.  We later moved to Southern California.  I knew one day I would return to Hawaii, the place I fell in love with long ago. I took a leap of faith and purchased my Maui condo June 2002 this was the beginning of fulfilling her prophecy to once again return to Hawaii soil.\r\n\r\nI am a tropical expression artist who paints on canvas and etched metal.  My work is inspired by the beauty of the islands and has been displayed in several Maui art galleries over the years.  I am a writer and have my first book on Amazon.

While I can usually overlook most shortcomings, the list was too many to ignore here. Wide angle pictures & professionally written listing descriptions will impress most - however, here are some takes from my REAL customer experience at the 414 condo:\n\n\"We will provide you with a special code to access the condo after you are booked and paid in full.\"\n\n- After a 13 day stay, we were charged a \"half day rate\" for a late checkout for 5 hours over our contracted stay. During our last day, we ended up being locked out of the condo. Thankfully the late checkout fee was refunded due to this situation. Not quite the goodbye from our paradise as we hoped for.\n\n\"This unit includes a window A/C in the living room should you need it although we find it is rarely needed because the tradewinds keep you comfortable.\"\n\n- The AC unit is a measly 12\" by 32\" window unit that had trouble keeping even the living room & kitchen areas cool. If 86 degrees in your bedroom while sleeping is \"comfortable\", then this might be the place for you.\n\n\"This setting is wonderful for romantic sunset strolls. For the more active person this is a great beach to run on as you can do so for miles in peace away from the crowds.\"  -- \"Three miles of quiet sandy beach will entice you to walk, run, or build sand castles.\"\n\n- Haycraft Park is roughly 500 feet away from the beach directly in front of this condo, and it was filled with people every day. Half the time we were here, there were campers there who stayed all day and over night with big fish lines across the entire beach. There may be other listings with better seclusion. \n\n\"This unit is spacious and bright.\"\n\n- Spacious? That's a stretch. But bright? You're absolutely spot on. If you enjoy sleeping in the dark, this place might NOT be for you. Waking up at 530am is ideal for the lighting of this condo, ever with the window shades (which many times had trouble coming down since they are on automatic motors). \n\nA POSITIVE NOTE:\nOne thing I cannot get over is the real Mahalo spirit of everyone staying and living at the Kana'i A Nalu resort. While my mother in law and 16 month old daughter got locked out on the last day, many guests there offered help, water, and to hang in their condos while we tried to wait patiently to get back in. The resort has an amazing location and even better spirit within its guests. \n"

Best location for anyone who wants the easiest access to all types of transportation for work or for leisure. As for parents like us travelling with an elderly and two active young children, Wilson's apartment is the best to meet our needs. Not only it is so clean and safe for kids, its convenient location allows us to return for nap and rest when kids are tired between our busy holiday schedules. Wilson is so approachable and very thoughtful in many details.\r\nClean linens, towels, kitchenware, clothes washing powder, indoor storable clothes liner, refills of every consumable daily essential items eg toilet papers, tissues etc.\r\nThere are some stairs upon entry into lobby/lift of the building but it is a very common feature in Hong Kong. You can open the French-door-type glass doors fully before you enter with big luggages. The building guards/administrators on duty are very friendly too.\r\nSurprisingly, it's so quiet and comfortable to sleep, considering its prime location in one of the busiest parts of Hong Kong. Eating, shopping, sightseeing...all within walking distance or so easy for additional transportation when preferred.\r\nThank you for making our stay in Hong Kong so memorable.\r\nStrongly recommended!"

The location was great it was close to the MTR/public transportation, restaurants, market, etc... The only con to the location is that it was a little hard to get a taxi because coming out of the building cars are not allowed to stop in that area so you would have to walk a bit when taking/coming from a taxi. This has nothing to do with wilson but I thought I would mention it anyways the elevator in this building is extremely slow. The apartment was decent, it didn't wow me or anything but as expected places in HK are small. For a group of 9 it was a bit tight but that didn't bother us since we were out most of the time. The apartment looks pretty much like the pictures there is one thing I would like to say is I wish Wilson would have taken pictures of the second bathroom to his place kus it was tiny. I'm a really tiny girl and even I had a hard time in there. So that probably would have changed my mind on picking his place to stay because we were really looking for a 2 bathroom place. I mean yes the small restroom is considered as 1 but it was so tiny that we didnt even use the shower in it kus it  was tiny but oh wells. Overall our stay was fine but I did feel like the floors could have been a bit more clean.  "

Building is more modern than most in the area, with a doorman and elevator. Apartment has an open view (not easy to come by on HK island!) Carmen keeps her place tidy and well equipped with everything you need. Bed is short (as others have noted) and the sofa is small too. Bathroom is basic but shower has hot water and ok pressure.

Some of visitors were too tall for the bed but with my 155cm height, I had no problem sleeping on it.  Hot water from shower was abundant. The view of skyscrapers from windows was good. I could even partly see New Years fireworks from windows. \n\nApartment concierges were at a ground floor 24 hours. They open the entrance door when you come home. Some of them can communicate in English. They are all kind and helpful.\n\nCarmen was super kind and communicative host. Her indication was accurate and helpful. She kindly left an octopus card for visitors to charge and use. \n\nThere is a washing machine in a listing but HongKong was too humid to dry laundry fast.  You can use a laundry shop next to the apartment. They wash and clean your laundry in a day.\n\nThe location was only a few minutes from a tram station. \nWalkable distance from Central and Causeway Bay. \n\nThere are many towns in HongKong but I am totally satisfied with staying in Wanchai. \nWanchai has modern skyscrapers, hipster attractions, and daily local markets and small restaurants.  St Francis street looked very sophisticated and I didn\u2019t feel unsafe. In front of the apartment, there are rainbow stairs which looks like an Instagram shooting spot and a lot of foreign people were taking photos. If you are a vegetarian, I strongly recommend a restaurant \u201c\u5929\u7136\u9f4b Green Veggie\u201d 15min from the apartment."

We were even provided with a welcoming gift! \nThere are, however, two downsides: the apartment is not equipped with an airconditioner or fan (which is not disastrous, but it can get pretty hot if you're not used to Portugese summers), and sounds from upstairs neighbours and the busy road it lies on can be heard at night. If you're a light sleeper, I suggest taking soundproof earplugs with you. \nOtherwise, it's a beautiful apartment if you want to enjoy both the city center of Porto and the beach!"

Despite of my insistance he paid for my dinner, dessert a nice tea afterward and paid for the minibus to the shisha place. Frankly, it might have exceeded the rent I paid. I wanted to go to Kurdistan but non of information was available in English he called the bus company for me and then he came with me to the bus terminal then he barganed on my behalf and I got a cheaper ticket as the result. He didn't leave until he made sure I went on my bus safely. In my return also his friend came with me to Taksim to make sure that I'm getting the right bus to Sabiha airport. I highly recommand him if you want a host who is also your tour guide and freind. Also the prices in the shops are considerably cheaper near his place rather than touristic area like Taksim and you are a 2 TL away from Taksim, so his place is ideal in any sense."

Pour ceux qui veulent faire du shopping ou du l\u00e8che vitrine il faudra surement prendre le metro pour aller un peu plus loin. Mais facilement accessible avec le metro.\r\nTr\u00e8s bonne premi\u00e8re exp\u00e9rience airbnb. \r\n"

First off, not cool, secondly he didn't offer to give us anything in return for this major inconvenience.  The other place was not up to our standards and we requested a refund which he made in cash.  This was kind of him, but still we want things to run smoothly.  Vacationing is amazing, but it's a costly affair that always adds additional stresses and one stress we like to avoid is accommodation issues."

There were great amenities to play Music, a nice bookshelf with various reads if you just want to read by the beach and chairs to take to the beach  to relax in between your snorkeling/swimming excursions. \n\nThe views - oh my god. The photos do not do it justice. We had sweeping views of the pacific and saw early morning paddle-boarders, surfers and sea turtles right from the balcony! Im sure if you come during the winter months, you can watch whales literally while drinking your morning coffee. No need to go to an expensive touristy bar to get that perfect Hawaiian sunset :) \n\nI don't know what else to say. Highly recommend for a great time."

How fabulous. Gluten free too for me - very thoughtful indeed. A lovely birthday card too left on the dresser. It's personal touches like this that make for a great stay.\r\n\r\nSo nice to know a bit about the history of where you're staying. Ann does a great talk on the history of the island.\r\n\r\nIf you think you'll need a little sleep in, take earplugs as the local birds get excited in the morning. A wonderful symphony to wake up to, but if you're trying to sleep...  \r\n\r\nDangar Island is just wonderful - we keep coming back. It is a truly special place.\r\n\r\nWe'll  come again - both to the island and would happily stay here again."

When i check the location, had to cancel and rushed to my ultimate accommodation portal, broadcasting generic message to nearby hosts to secure an accommodation the soonest.\r\n\r\nAlison was among the first to reply, and to pre-confirm...\r\nBy the time i got there, Adam was already waiting for me and even kind enough to give me all the directions at 8am and off course waited for me outside to make sure that i'm paying the right cab fee. \r\n\r\nWhat can i say Adam, made feel at home from very first moment, kind, genuine and warm welcoming host. The house is is really nice fully refurbished, in a quite and well connected neighbourhood. My room was upstairs, a nice sunny room with  a queen bed and a bathroom attached. After i dropped in my luggage, Adam gave me guided orientation tour to the house, with access to all amenities. \r\n\r\nFelt like a VIP 5 star treatment as Adam even gave me a pre-paid bus ticket, which made my first(s) bus rides easier as some stations are pre-paid only.  So now that you that i have been at a great apartment, with great hosts, that's all, Rozelle is a really nice neighbourhood. walking distance from my hosts' place, you can make it to the main street packed, with cafe, bars and restaurant, a vibrant market and lot of attractions. if you happen to stay over a weekend don't miss Rozelle Market (Sat & Sun). \r\n\r\nNow the funny part, Adam was so happy to receive me as he's a all star backgammon player and he knows that Lebanese people are really good at that and he was so eager for round. One night we decided to play a round and Adam's expectations went all down the drain, i think i was the first Lebanese ever to be clumsy backgammon player. We agree that we will play another time via (Hidden by Airbnb) and i will have support from fellow Lebanese players :)\r\n\r\nAll in all, i great time, the house is warm, clean, and comfortable and the hosts are simply AWESOME  \r\n\r\n "

Since the appartment is in the city center there is no fabulos view from none of the windows - but this does not matter at all.\r\n \r\nThere is also a Nespresso coffee machine in the modern kitchen (bring the capsules by your one or there is a Nespresso shop 100m away).\r\n \r\nWe can fully recomand this special appartment and Lluis as perfect host in this wunderful city.\r\nMuchos gracias Lluis!!\r\n \r\nMarcella and familiy\r\n\r\n *   * \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDas Appartment ist in unmittelbarer N\u00e4he vom \u00f6ffentlichen Verkehr und der grossen Einkaufsstrasse \"Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia\" mit unz\u00e4hligen L\u00e4den, Cafes und Restaurants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIdeal f\u00fcr einen Sightseeing-Aufenthalt in Barcelona, da zentral gelegen (ca. 10 min zu Fuss zur Pla\u00e7a Catalunya, 2 min zum Taxi-Stand und Bus-Haltestellen).\r\n\r\n\r\nWir waren zu 5. f\u00fcr drei Tage in Lluis Wohnung und haben uns sofort sehr wohl gef\u00fchlt. Lluis war bei der Schl\u00fcssel\u00fcbergabe bereits vor Ort und hat uns gute Tipps f\u00fcr Barcelona gegeben. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDie Wohnung ist neu renoviert, modern eingerichtet und hat wundersch\u00f6ne alte B\u00f6den und Stuckaturen in manchen Zimmern.\r\n\r\nEs hat eine automatische L\u00fcftung: Die Temperatur kann manuell eingestellt werden (sehr angenehm).\r\n\r\nDer verglaste Raum (\u201eWintergarten\u201c) ist ein zus\u00e4tzlicher Raum mit Aussicht auf den Innenhof (die Aussicht ist jetzt nicht wirklich atemberaubend, aber es ist sehr gem\u00fctlich). Eine sch\u00f6ne Aussicht gibt es von keinem Fenster aus, da sich die Wohnung Mitten in der Stadt befindet - St\u00f6rt aber nicht.\r\n\r\nEs hat eine Nespresso-Kaffee-Maschine (Kapseln selber mitbringen oder 100m von der Wohnung gibt\u2019s einen Nespresso-Shop).\r\n\r\n\r\nWir k\u00f6nnen die Wohnung und Lluis als Gastgeber nur weiterempfehlen.\r\n\r\nMuchos gracias Lluis!!!\r\n\r\n\r\nMarcella and familiy\r\n"

                "txt": "I stayed at USA Stay's apartment for a little over 2 months while I was on a business trip in New York. Excellent location if you prefer a quiet neighborhood. There is quite a number of restaurants and shops close by and it is only two blocks away to Central Park. Public transportation is within walkable distance too. \nPlease note that you will need to buy some necessities such as trash bags, shampoos and so on as this is not an apartment that someone currently lives in (more of a hotel style with an empty furnished room). Also the streets could be a little loud at night because it faces to Madison Avenue. The service calls were handled promptly. Check in and out were easy. \nOverall I enjoyed my stay at this apartment and would recommend it to anyone who prefers a convenient location but not right into midtown where the traffics are. "

The location is prime, very easy to hop on a bus or subway and make it anywhere. Nightlife is not big around, it's actually quiet and nice at night. Dave from USA Stay was super nice and helped solving certain issues that came up. The communication was great. There's a little market and cleaners downstairs, which is super convenient, and a Duane Read/Walgreens a couple of blocks away. You'll be 1 block from Central Park and the apt itself is incredibly cozy. You'll feel at home. Thank you!"

You hear traffic from Madison Avenue, your neighbours and noisy radiators. Sometimes the water will never get hot, forcing you to take cold showers. Radiators may not work on cold days.\nWe stayed for two months in a nice location but the apartment disappointed us, especially when we considered the high price of our 2 months stay."

Nearest subway station is on either 96th street (6 train) or 86th street (4,5,6 trains).\n\nThe apartment is on the third floor of the building. The neighbourhood is generally quiet with the exception of traffic noises and bus noises (there's a bus stop right below) but apart from that it's generally quiet at night. \n\nIt's a cosy apartment, and has everything you would typically need. The small First aid kit works well, however do note that the freezer section doesn't work, so avoid purchasing items that require freezing. Wifi and cable TV works well too.\n\nI had no problems with the hot water in the shower, but do note that it does take a few minutes for it to get hot. \n\nCommunication was great and the host, he was always quick to respond to questions or any problems. I found them incredibly communicative and helpful. \n\nI stayed for a period of two months. I am seldom around during the day as I am at work, and am usually only around at night. \n\nOverall I am satisfied with the apartment and my stay. \n\nThank you very much!"

First thing we saw upon entering were cockroaches in the kitchen area - without even having any food around or cooking. This was not properly disclosed before arrival. Although they sent somebody over who laid out baits, the roaches did not disappear. Second, (at least) two times there were unannounced strangers entering the apartment in order to look at it or to even take pictures. We know because we were at the apartment at this time. Third, the apartment faces Madison Ave, so it is rather loud. In addition, the windows are not well sealed so it gets cold/hot easily. Overall, considering what you get, the apartment is overpriced. In addition to get the key, you have to travel across the city to pick it up - very inconveniently."

BUT the airbnb experience - talking to locals - was missing.\r\n\r\nThe only thing, which is offended me, were the watch/stuff-salesmen right out of the guest house."

One part of the guesthouse was under renovation but Natalie gave me a bigger better room without charging me extra. The room itself was super clean, comfortable and perfect for a short holiday in Hong Kong. It had everything I needed - AC, little bathroom with shower, fresh towel everyday, shampoo and a big comfortable bed. You also feel really safe as you can only get into the guesthouse and room with a special keycard. The staff was super helpful too and so was Natalie. I only met her in person once, but she is incredibly friendly and really makes sure you have a pleasant stay. I can recommend the guesthouse for those who travel by themselves and need a quiet room to come back to in the midst of bustling Hong Kong. Thanks a lot, Natalie! All the best, Juliana"

Not only was the place exactly what we needed but Paul is a genuinely nice, kind, interesting human being and it has been a pleasure to get to know him. We stayed as a couple for just over a month and miss it already. Paul showed us around the neighbourhood when we first got there and was easily contactable thereafter.\r\n\r\nPaul's place is a unique gem decorated with his quirky eye for colour, style and collectible treasures. It has a cozy well decked out living room, a bedroom with a closet and a comfortable bed, spacious bathroom and a nice, sunny, open-plan kitchen surrounded by windows. It is neat and well organised. There is cooling and heating in every room (plus fans), and the kitchen is well stocked with pots, pans, and other requirements along with a nice big fridge and freezer.  We found the place had everything we needed for a comfortable long-term stay.\r\n\r\nFor us, the location so close to three big parks (incl. Central Park), Columbia and Harlem, was just right. There are transport options aplenty: bikes up and down Riverside Park, the 1 MTA line two blocks away and frequent Broadway buses.  Paul kindly lent us his two bikes which was a fab way to get around the city. Being located on the border of UWS is great as it is a relatively quiet area to stay but the rest of Manhattan is readily accessible through the 1 line meaning we got the best of Manhattan action combined with good sleeping! Would stay again in a flash!"

I was in NYC for 2 weeks at Columbia and the location was just a few blocks away. I didn't want to deal with transit in the AM, although that would not have been a big issue anyway.  Plus, it's right off broadway (the broadway that has shows) so subways access was great. Since it's a college town, I felt super safe and there were minimal tourists and minimal bums also. A couple things to note: this is actually Paul's residence so there are some personal affects to be mindful of.  I really appreciated that though because I was able to tap into the Tylenol and bandaids in the medicine cabinet over the course of 2 weeks. Hey, anything can happen!  He was totally respectful of my privacy and wasn't popping in or out during my stay.  I'm hopeful that if Teachers college has anymore trainings that I get to go to, Paul's place is available!"

Our room was big enough for us,shower and toilet in the room, all was perfect. We could use the kitchen, which we did every morning. Well, what else is there to say? I told her, whenever we visit Maui, we will stay with her.

We were 10-12 mins walk from the subway Alfonso X only 4 stops from the Ramblas which was \"thumbs up\".\r\n\r\nWe loved our stay our two children were very comfortable in the apartment and loved the patio, there were ample playgrounds in close proximity.

Falta de limpieza absoluta en toda la casa que hac\u00eda muy inc\u00f3moda su estancia y m\u00e1s con ni\u00f1os peque\u00f1os. El sof\u00e1 donde supuestamente se pod\u00eda dormir, ten\u00eda una gran mancha que ni se hab\u00edan molestado en intentar limpiarla. Solo hab\u00eda un \u00fanico armario recubierto de moho para guardar la ropa, que evidentemente no pudimos utilizar. La ducha estaba negra, picada y oxidada, lo que nos toc\u00f3 limpiar a nosotros y desinfectarla un poco para poderla utilizar. La cocina llena cubierta por una capa de grasa que la hac\u00eda in\u00fatil para cocinar cualquier cosa. Escaleras hacia abajo completamente empinadas y estrechas.  Nada m\u00e1s llegar ni rastro de Regina o Juan, nos atendi\u00f3 una persona que ni siquiera sab\u00eda hablar bien castellano, por lo que dudo mucho de la existencia de Juan y Regina. Es absolutamente indignante que cuando pagas el apartamento te cobran unos gastos de limpieza que no han efectuado. Para colmo nos cobraron 30 \u20ac en concepto de checking. La zona es tranquila aunque bastante alejada del metro, dado que tienes unas cuestas muy empinadas desde la parada m\u00e1s cernada de metro y luego toca subir cuesta arriba unos 15 minutos. De cara a los esfuerzos por parte del anfitri\u00f3n, absolutamente ninguno. La persona que nos recibi\u00f3 ni siquiera sab\u00eda indicarnos donde estaba la tienda m\u00e1s cercana, un parking donde poder dejar el coche e incluso la parada de metro m\u00e1s cernada. Soy usuario de esta web desde hace tiempo, he visitado otros pa\u00edses de Europa us\u00e1ndola y ha sido con creces la peor experiencia que he tenido. Me siento completamente estafado."

I have a cat allergy but she was so friendly and hospitable that I even managed to give her a few good pats. Teodora's place is very clean, so my allergic reaction was minimal. \r\n\r\nThe location is great. It's less than a 10 min walk to the Metro and very easy to find street parking. We enjoyed the garden space very much. We sat out there one late afternoon and felt as though we were truly Montreal residents!\r\n\r\nOne suggestion I make (which is NOT a deal breaker) is perhaps a small fan in the guest room. The windows are not very big, and we kept the door closed, to keep Tsitsou out, and it got stuffy pretty quickly. \r\n\r\nI will be giving Teodora a 10/10 and we hope to come back to visit soon!"

She even provided us with a second clean pair of bed sheets and allowed us to use pans and spices to cook (as eating out can get quite expensive!) Everything was excellent, and I would definitely recommend anyone who stays in Montreal to stay with Sabrina!"

It's a spacious apartment with two beautiful bathrooms and amazing views. Even a large balcony with deck chairs. This apartment truly had everything we needed. There was a chemist near the ground floor doors, and a convenience store as well; coffee shops and cafes are nearby, and an excellent DFO shopping centre nearby (within walking distance; 1.3km I think).

From the island magazines to help find good recommendations to the island map sitting out to help you find your way, Samantha put a lot of effort to make the stay very welcoming.  The place is on a small side street in north Kihei which is out little outside of the main town area, perfect for what we were looking for.  A short walk from the beach where you can see the sunset, but also very central on the island to get around.  Definitely would stay here again.\n\nMahalo!"

He sent us a detailed \"Welcome Packet\" which included very useful tips for our Maui adventure. The condo was 100% clean and included everything one may need to prepare meals and have an enjoyable and relaxing stay. Prior to our arrival, he actually replaced most all the kitchen items such as silverware, dishes, cooking utensils, pots and pans, etc. The furnishings (including the beds) were extremely comfortable and the panoramic view, condo grounds and beach were SPECTACULAR!!! It was especially nice having a casual open-air restaurant on the property.

They always responded me in a swift manner with good solutions to all of my minor issues (including the early arrival, coffee machine repair, cleaning service question and light bulb request). \nI liked the apartment very much. It was convenient to do anything in the city and quiet and comfortable to sleep at night. To highlight the convenience, I want to note that the nearest supermarket is just one or two blocks away (to the north) and pubs and restaurants are also a block away (to the south). Some may worry about bugs at such location, but during my 40-day stay, I did not have any bug issues. \nThe only possible setbacks I can think of are the tiny kitchen sink and occasional odor from outside. \nThe kitchen sink is certainly small although this place has a dishwasher. So, for a short stay and people who do not cook very much will not have any problems. However, if you want to do dishes during your stay, you will probably find the sink space cramped. \nThe outside smell was very occasional during my stay in a rainy summer (I think it was related to the weather). When I noticed the weird smell, I just needed to close the windows to shut it out. The AC works very well. So, it was not a big deal for me to do so. \nOverall, I am happy with the values and qualities I got here, and I would highly recommend this place to anybody who wants to enjoy the city activities and have good rests in the same time."

We could not even manage to watch starred TV.. & it was more frustrating to also realise that most of the Foxtel channels were not subscribed to, therefore there isn't anything PLATNIUM about this packgage! This is not a 1br, it is an older style, but externally refurbished block, there was no room to move & even if we did get the TV working, there was no chance of watching it due to the dining setting blocking the view.

The location is central to driving to Kihei, Lahaina, Paia or Kahalui. One of the best places my family has stayed.  There are charming ducks and chickens roaming around on the property - the only slight downside was the great amount of duck poop on the porch every morning but it was an easy cleanup with the outside hose.

Property itself looks even better than in the pictures and it is quite large. House is very nice and you will probably find everything you need even though if you plan to cook every day you might be somewhat limited. Biggest problem we encountered is something that looked cool at the beginning - ducks walking around the property. They would constantly poop at the front deck and the deck would quickly become disgusting and unusable. Even if you wash it out with the hose, it will take them no time to make the mess again. However, somehow they decided to leave the back (ocean side) deck alone so we were able to truly enjoy the beautiful view.  I would recommend the place to couples or families with older children - not babies or small kids as the bedrooms are awkwardly placed (one is right at the entrance door) so you have to walk through the whole house to get to second bedroom. The host vas very helpful and responded quickly to all our questions.\n"

If you stay here, be sure to check out Dim Dim Sum and the Biang Biang noodles at Yau Yuen Siu Tsui (a michelin guide restaurant just across the street from the apartment)-- the best noodles I've ever eaten. \n\nThe apartment is small but nicely furnished. Very clean. One thing to note is that the small kitchen has a stovetop and microwave, but no oven. Perfect for cooking a simple breakfast, but not really set up to cook an elaborate meal.\n\nI'd definitely recommend this apartment as a great place to stay in Hong Kong, especially if you're looking for a less touristy location.

Our room and bathroom were clean and the beds comfortable for our family of three.  The internet worked well and her rooftop terrace was pleasant for afternoon tea and breakfast.  In fact, Nuria offered us tea on the roof upon our arrival.  We enjoyed having use of the kitchen during our stay.  The elevator in her building was nice for carrying luggage up and down.  Our Spanish and Nuria\u2019s English were minimal, but we were able to communicate.  This is certainly not a luxurious place, but good for those traveling within a budget.   "

The thing is that you won't want to spend that much time there because the neighborhood is amazing--which was also accurately advertised. We walked or took the metro everywhere and never used our car (we lucked out and found a parking spot right after the street had been cleaned and all the other cars had to move). There are so many great restaurants, cafes and boutiques nearby, and also a sweet park right at the top of the street. We walked to Mont Royal (and then walked to the top for an amazing view), and walked to the Metro stop to get to downtown (for free concerts at the Jazz Festival), the old port, and the Jean Talon market. Also, Libby was very helpful and available via email (and if my phone worked, I assume text as well); has lots of maps and brochures in the apartment for you to look at and use; and her housecleaner, who met us and gave us the keys, was lovely and full of tips about the city. We can't wait to come back and explore more! "

Being on a high floor the hot water doesn't run for particularly long but it's fine if you leave a bit of time between showers. Checking in and out was super easy! The building is in a wonderful location, we walked easily to Haymarket, Darling Harbour, the Rocks, and Circular Quay. TIP: If you are driving into the city, this is not the place to stay. Parking was a nightmare. Jared does warn that parking is expensive (he mentions $69 in the apartment description) but what I didn't realise is it's not just a $69 flat rate for more than three hours, it's $69 the first day, $50 overnight, then $69 for the next day.

Lamentablemente, es dif\u00edcil llevarse una imagen positiva despu\u00e9s de que te roben. El d\u00eda antes de nuestra partida encontramos la luna del coche rota, y todo lo que hab\u00eda de valor, sustra\u00eddo. Es una pr\u00e1ctica habitual, no fue una excepci\u00f3n. La consiguiente desesperaci\u00f3n, al estar \"abandonados\" en otro pa\u00eds, s\u00f3lo la conoce quien la padece. Adem\u00e1s, no hab\u00edamos aparcado en una zona  conflictiva, sino en un barrio residencial, muy cerca del apartamento. \nLo verdaderamente problem\u00e1tico no es el robo en s\u00ed, sino el hecho, ante la perspectiva de un largo viaje para volver a casa, de no tener ayuda posible: que el seguro no responda, no tener internet en el tel\u00e9fono, etc\u00e9tera, hecho que probablemente constituya un incentivo para los ladrones, pues es obvio que act\u00faan desde el rencor.\nSi Margarida dispone el aparcamiento trasero a la casa todo ser\u00e1 m\u00e1s seguro. No le recomiendo a nadie dejar el coche en la calle.\nEs recomendable tambi\u00e9n, controlar los precios de las tarifas de datos, ya que la Wi-Fi que nos fue brindada solo funcion\u00f3 el primer d\u00eda, y se hace muy necesaria estando de viaje. \nPor otro lado, es dif\u00edcil llegar a entender para un espa\u00f1ol (que tenemos fama de fiesteros y gritones) como es posible que en una zona residencial todas las noches se re\u00fana gente en una plaza a beber y hablar hasta las cuatro o cinco de la ma\u00f1ana. El caso es que como la visita ha sido en agosto y el calor era insoportable, ten\u00edamos que tener las ventanas abiertas y era muy dif\u00edcil dormir, pues la gente no ten\u00eda ninguna consideraci\u00f3n ni civismo en este aspecto.\nEsto no pretende ser una cr\u00edtica destructiva; quiz\u00e1 tuvimos mala suerte, y aunque creo que hay aspectos a mejorar, el apartamento es una  buena oportunidad para conocer la ciudad, sobre todo por su relaci\u00f3n calidad-precio y porque Margarida responde siempre con una sonrisa. Aun teniendo en cuenta los aspectos se\u00f1alados, estoy seguro de que con el tiempo el recuerdo ser\u00e1 bueno."

We were only a few blocks from the L train, which is one stop from the city making it pretty convenient - though we ended up cabbing it most of the time. \r\nWilly, the host, was great, very easy to communicate with and everything was super smooth. No complaints. Hope to stay there again sometime. If you are a TV junky, do be aware there isn't one in the apartment, but we spied one in the common area you may be able to take advantage of.\r\nOverall, 5 stars without a doubt!"

My girlfriend and I had a fantastic stay in Willy's apartment and we wish we could return.\r\n\r\nWe booked this place almost last minute as I had to move to New York to start a job and look at apartments. We're glad we went with this one. It is half a block away from the R and only a few blocks from basically every other subway line worth having in Brooklyn. We could be in Manhattan in a minute's notice. \r\n\r\nIt is only a few blocks away from Montague St, the short shopping street in the middle of Brooklyn Heights, and a little farther away from Court St, the main shopping street this side of the Gowanus Canal. In short, the location is ideal. Don't pass this place up.\r\n\r\nThe apartment itself is spacious and light. The main room/bed room has two windows on three of its four walls and is constantly filled with light. The girl who lives there is a photographer, and it is obvious that she cares about the quality of the light in the room. To top it off, the apartment is appropriately accented with a few mirrors, which brightens the space even more. The bed, with its foam and vinyl mattress, is an absolute pleasure to sleep on. \r\n\r\nThose who come to New York fearing about grime and pests need not be afraid of this apartment. It is kept immaculately clean, and we stayed there ten days without seeing even a single fly. \r\n\r\nSheets and towels are provided, as well as a mostly empty closet and lots of reading material. The internet in the apartment has its ups and downs, but is mostly and unfortunately fairly slow.\r\n\r\nAgain, you would be a fool to pass this place up, especially at this price. "

The complex is absolutely stunning with beautiful well maintained grounds and the pool area and views were absolutely gorgeous. The apartment was clean, well equipped and comfortable.  The only downside was that the bedroom is near the front of the unit and the traffic noise was quite loud, making it difficult to fall asleep. This is probably due to the fact the one of the window fixture in the bedroom is an open blind, offering great air flow but not much in noise reduction. However, this probably wouldn't bother a heavy sleeper or could be easily be minisimed with earplugs. On the whole we would definitely recommend!  "

The views of the ocean were amazing, the resort is well kept and the landscaping is beautiful. Turtles were in the ocean at the edge of the property every morning, and we were usually able to scurry down with coffee or a mimosa and watch them swim and come up for air. The pool was rarely, if ever, used during our stay, so you could have it all to yourself. The BBQ are was clean and well-kept. This condo is on the third floor with stairs up, so if you have physical limitations it might be a struggle. However, the third floor placement allows for extremely quieter accommodations and an unparrelleled view of the ocean. The bedroom is on the street side, so road noise does creep in during the evenings. We easily slept and the noise didn't bother us at all. The fans and open windows kept us cool during the evenings with no need for AC (this unit does not have it). Although we didn't meet Ken in person, he provided us with all the information we needed to enjoy the condo without worry. This place is well stocked, clean and convenient. Highly recommended."

That alone would have made staying here worth it, but on top of that, Keneke has stocked the condo chock-full of kitchen supplies and extra beach towels. Two advisories: the condo is on the small side for more than two people, although it can technically sleep four (two in the real bed and two on the pullout couch), and careful with parking here because other guests and owners can get a bit possessive, especially if they have large cars. Also, you definitely should have a car if you stay here because while a few markets/delis and shops are walkable, the town of Lahaina is not. I heartily recommend this wonderful clean condo!"

As it was our first airbnb experience we were a bit nervous, however it turned out to be a dream holiday. \r\nWe arrived at the flat and were met by Lola (the building guard) who gave us the keys and showed us around the apartment. It was perfect. Clean and tastefully decorated with all the kitchen appliances you could need! \r\nWe chose the apartment for the balcony and views and were blown away. You can see the whole of Barcelona from the balcony, all the way to the sea. Perfect for a sunny evening with a bottle of wine! The best thing about the balcony is that you are not overlooked by anyone. It is completely private and being so high up you are not disturbed by the noise of the road. \r\nThe flat itself is about a 10 minute walk from the metro station Guinardo and it's only a couple of minutes on the metro into town. The metro shuts around midnight so a few late nights we treated ourselves to a taxi back which cost about $11.\r\nLots of little supermarkets nearby to stock up and also several nice bars and cafes if you dont fancy the journey into town. \r\nAll in all was a perfect trip. Fantastic apartment which was great value for money. Would 100% recommend Enriques apartment and will certainly be staying again in the future.  "

Tivesse so good I barely went to the gym which is literally minutes away. \n\nCesar was super kind, he is definitely not your regular Airbnb host.

And we realized that it was quite difficult to find such place in Barcelona.  But Patricia's apartment was exactly what we were looking for.  It's located in Gracia disctrict which is 5 minutes walk from Passage de Gracia (one of the main streets of Barcelona which brings you to the Cataloniya square).  But at the same time it's a district where local people leave and it has a charm old Barcelona - historical buildings, nice cosy squares full of life, plenty of food shops and even market with fresh sea food, vegetables and Spanish specialities.  This is exactly the place where you can feel the real, not turistic Barcelona.  We felt very comfortable and safe there.  The apartment is simple but has everything you need - 2 big comfortable bads, kitchen with oven, microwave and all the necessary utensils.  There is also washing machine but we did not use it.  In one of sleeping rooms there is a small cosy balcony where you can enjoy your glass of wine or breakfest.  Due to the fact that both sleeping-rooms windows looks to the patio, it's absolutely quiet at night.  And you can only hear a sound of old clock which goes from the clocktower on the neighboring square which is the main square of Gracia district.  That gives you a wonderfull feeling of being in another century.  So, we got all we have expected and even more:).  And Patricia was also great as host.  We had only one problem with wi-fi in the first day which she fixed immediately that day.  It was very easy and comfortable for us to communicate with Patricia.  So, we would recommend her appartment to those who want to enjoy real Barcelona in a comfortable and quiet way:). "

Isabel was a gracious host who kept in good communication.  There was a small issue with check-in (the concierge was late to drop off our keys) and if you are a light sleeper you may want to bring earplugs as noise from the upstairs neighbours tended to reverberate through the floorboards.  Overall, it was an excellent base for our short stay in Porto (far more authentic and beautiful than a hotel room) and we would be happy to return. Thank you."

They don't speak English, but are very charming and helpful, so we communicated via (Hidden by Airbnb) Translate, using (Hidden by Airbnb) .\n\nThe building is slightly older. One day there was no water in the building due to maintenance. The hosts warned me about this, there was nothing they could do and I was prepared. Only issue is that after the water came back, because of the older pipes, it was brown for a little while, just have to let the taps run for several minutes. \n\nThe bed isn't the most comfortable for an extended stay (I was there for eight nights), but for short durations it's fine. \n\nThere is a washing machine in the apartment, it works great, I dried my clothes by hanging them on chairs, hooks, etc. \n\nThe WiFi is strong and reliable. \n\nThere is a grocery store and a couple of reasonably priced restaurants on the block, as well as two different banks. Excellent for visitors. A drug store is also available on the next block at the corner. \n\nOverall the inconveniences were small and the positives of this location was great. "

She responded to everything and does actually live close by (a good thing too, because the door code wasn't working when we arrived, but it was quickly addressed).  She was also helpful in giving us a bit of extra time for check-out.\n\nJust to say a couple things about the actual condo, the pictures do portray it in the best possible light.  Nothing deceptive, but there are elements that could use updating that are not shown.  The bathrooms need some TLC and there are lots of wires and cords everywhere (especially the bedrooms).  Everything else was clean and safe.  The kitchen is up-to-date with every appliance you should need, including a blender and toaster.  There is a newer washer and dryer right in the unit, which is very convenient.  We didn't use the TVs, but there are 3 of them - one in the main living room and one in each bedroom.  Parking was very convenient - a reserved spot that's just steps away from the ground level entrance (the condo is on the ground level and doesn't have any stairs).  There are several beach accessories waiting as well - a cooler, beach chairs and boogie boards are there for your use, along with plenty of beach towels.  There are 3 AC units and all of them worked, but they are noisy.\n\nThe noise level outside was generally good.  There were a few inconsiderate very early morning departures from other units, but nothing major.  The park across the road closes at 8pm, so there was no late-night noise to speak of.\n\nThe location in general is great.  The park across the road is not a swimming beach (no sand, too many rocks), but it's very popular for surfing and paddleboarding lessons.  There are several sandy beaches just a short drive (or healthy walk) away.  Kihei in general is a great spot to stay, as it's near several  great beaches (Big Beach in Makena is epic) and is central to a lot of things you'll want to see - the upscale Wailea area is just a short drive away and several other destinations are easily driveable from Kihei.  There are lots of food choices close by and many of them offer some of the best value you'll find in Maui.  There's also 2 supermarkets right down the road (and Foodland is open until 1am).\n\nTo summarize, the condo was more \"rustic\" than we were expecting, but I will say that in the area, you'd likely have to pay a bit more for something more updated that has 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms."

Jennifer's place was literally right across the street from Kalama Beach Park & a very short walk (~10 min.) from Charley Young Beach. Her place is very centrally located in Kihei: directly next to the surf/paddleboard rental, 5 min. walking distance from a shopping village, & in the middle of the island, which is nice if you plan on doing the drives to Mt. Haleakala or the Road to Hana. Safeway is a short ~5 min. drive & Costco & the airport are a ~30 minute drive away. Her place has everything you need: kitchen, washer/dryer, beach towels/chairs, nice outdoor patio with a nice, small pool. I highly recommend her place if you want a quiet, quaint, peaceful place to relax where everything you need is a short distance away. Jennifer was also very prompt in her responses and very easy to get a hold of. Thanks again for everything, Jennifer!!! My family & I loved everything about our stay at your place."

You are steps to Central Park and to the 86th subway.  There are wonderful restaurants and shopping nearby if you need that but the small kitchen is fine for quick snacks and breakfast.  It was especially nice to sit on the little patio to eat my toast and tea and even with the NYC humming around you it is lovely to have an outdoor space.  Chas answered all my many questions with great patience and care...he really wanted us to have a wonderful time and went beyond the call of duty by even sending us links to good places to watch big soccer matches.  The apartment was clean when we arrived and had the basic things we needed such as towels and extra sheets.  While not the cheapest option on BNB it gave us all a wonderful bed to sleep in, space to spread out in when needed, and a fantastic location!  We even found street parking for the full 5 days!  Picking up the keys was a breeze and we left a few basic things for the next guests to enjoy from the corner store.   It is a gorgeous street to stay on and felt very safe. Thank you so much Chas!  We hope to return one day soon."

We had a slight issue with the internet on day 2 which again was dealt with promptly and efficiently. \n\nThe apartment is tastefully decorated and appointed to a high standard and it was also very comfortable. We felt very much at home. \n\nOn the first night we noticed a little traffic noise  ( as was expected from a city centre location) but this was significantly minimized when the outer shutters and inner ornate shutters were closed. \n\nThe apartment is located in a lovely spot, very central but a block or so away from where the main tourist congregations.  We enjoyed exploring the city away from the bulk of the tourists. \n\nI would definitely recommend this apartment."

The Zona Sul, an upmarket supermarket indeed around the corner (corner Rua Jardim Botanico and Rua Pacheco Leao). We very much liked La Biciclette for breakfast, it is a French bakery on the corner of Rua Pacheco Leao and Rua Von Martius. Also we liked the restaurant SOBE in the Rua Pacheco Leao.

Luckily, I have more space. \r\n\r\nThe room is just as the pictures display: huge, clean, and comfy! There's a 2persons bed, a build-in closet, another closet with drawers, a book case, a big desk, and a comfy sofa to relax on. Although the room offers more space than you probably need, you can also just hang out in the cozy living room. But the best place has to be the back yard, which Laura turned in a little green oasis. It's the ideal spot to relax after a long day, enjoy the sun, or have a home dinner. And no need to feel lonely as Lulu - a.k.a. the most adorable cat ever - and his buddies from the block are always around somewhere (especially if you give them some of your ham sandwich or sushi). \r\n\r\nI've stayed at Laura's for several months and I've never felt so at home in another person's house. Laura went above and beyond to make my stay as pleasant as possible. I was new to Montreal (actually I was new to Canada) and didn't know any people other than a few colleagues. Laura embraced me as a friend and made sure I never had to feel alone or get bored, while also giving me all the privacy I wanted. \r\n\r\nThe neighbourhood has everything you need. The house is near  shops, supermarkets, cafe's, restaurants, parks (including the Mont Royal), several busstops, 2 metro stations (Laurier & Mont Royal; both 10 min walking distance), and there's and there's always some fun - often free - festival around the corner in the summer. Despite all this the street is actually really quiet and is very safe!\r\n\r\n"

Aircons noisy in that room too but fan also available. Kitchen well equipped and good washing machine and drying racks. Lounge had good comfortable furniture and large dining table. Wi-fi worked well. Only issue we had was part of the tiling in the kitchen spontaneously cracked and broke leaving the doorway into the kitchen with a very uneven entrance. Host provided a tarpaulin and offered us two free extra nights which made up for the inconvenience, an offer we were able to take up. Communication with host was through (Hidden by Airbnb) ."

The apartment overlooks the main street which is full of nightlife and restaurants. With the windows open it could be a  bit noisy, but when they are closed it was very quiet so it was not an issue! Having the metro so close made traveling the city very easy. The biggest challenge was parking, if you plan to have a car your only decent overnight options require you to walk quite a bit. Check - in was very easy I would recommend this apartment for friends or couples looking to enjoy the Gay Village and downtown Montreal."

Max $4/day for unlimited bus rides and no parking hassles what-so-ever!  (Read reviews for car rental at OGG and you'll find another great reason for going car-free! Not recommended, however, if you wish to do inner island sight-seeing such as Haleakala or Road to Hana.) There is parking under the building.\n\nSafeway is 2 blocks away and fabulous Baby Beach is a 10 minute walk. BTW, Baby Beach is spectacular. Easily the clearest water I've ever snorkeled in. Swim between circular coral outcroppings to see tropical fish and sea turtles. At low tide, wade out hundreds of yards and the water is not even waist high.  Kaanapali Beach - miles of sand, waves and tiki bars is just a half hour walk north or 12 minute bus ride. Easy to get to Black Rock for more superior snorkeling.\n\nComfortable Murphy bed in the living room lets you sleep to gentle breezes and the sound of the ocean. Nice (and very clean) pool area overlooking the ocean is the perfect spot to see sea turtles feeding at dawn and dusk. Very helpful manager on site who will take you out snorkeling, if you just ask.\n\nEvery appliance and amenity you need for a relaxing vacation.  Can't wait to go back!"

This part of Brooklyn is what New York is all about, a real mix, I would recommend it to anyone that is deciding between staying in  Manhattan or elsewhere outside the big apple. Jon has been very responsive throughout the period we secure the property. Even when his oven stopped working - which was a big deal for us - he told us in advance and managed to secure an alternative, which we finally decided not to use (hope that's ok Jon). My only comment that I think could improve anyone's stay in the future is a mini map of the house pointing to where the basics are, what to use and what not to. It is almost self intuitive, but for someone that was using the service for the first time, I had lots of questions at the very beginning. Can I use this?, do you mind if we eat that?, in any case as I said Jon was always very responsive despite being away in the busiest annual holiday of the year."

Loved that there was ample sunlight that passed through the apartment. Parking space was a little tight. Recommend to get a smaller car if you intend to rent one. There are certain things to take note, response from host was not very prompt. Asked for late check out several times and only managed to receive a reply after 3 texts and emails. Parking garage was renovating the day I arrived but was not informed earlier and had to pay for parking several hours. Overall, a good experience."

She was an excellent host who communicated with me swiftly and effectively - our check-in was completely hassle free - and we were welcomed with fresh bread, fruit, and milk. We will definitely look to stay here again and highly recommend it to the airbnb community. "

Laundry is 10 blocks away since the hostess isn't in town, the sheets may not be clean so you'll have to do them yourself. Maria is always available via text so very helpful. If you drive, underground parking is a block away. Rental bikes are also close by. I would definitely stay there again for a quick weekend visit to Montreal."

This was my first time using an airbnb apartment and I enjoyed feeling I was \"at home\" rather than at a hotel. I also really liked the neighbourhood. I felt that I was living among the locals and enjoyed picking up coffee in the local pastry shops. Although the apartment is located pretty close to the Sagrada Familia, I didn't feel I was in a touristy area. The apartment is very close to a couple of metro lines, and we used the metro a lot. It was fast and efficient -- and got us wherever we wanted to go in the city. "

C\u00e1tia provided a comprehensive overview of Porto when we met her at the flat and all her recommendations of what to see, where to go and restaurants to eat at were excellent. We didn't have time for your francesinha challenge C\u00e1tia but we'll take it up next time! The flat is in an excellent location; easy walking distance from attractions, but also in an area of great local bars and shops. Many happy times watching the world go by, and the football, at Cafe Java. And of course the roof top terrace is an excellent place to relax and enjoy wine, or beer, after a day of exploring the steep streets and many steps of Porto. We will most definitely be returning. Thank you C\u00e1tia and David."

I have been living here since 2010.\r\nSince then, I did not manage to get back and got in love with Porto. The seagulls, the Douro and the amazing color of the sun set, will without a doubt, make you also fall in love with this beautiful city.\r\nMake sure that you check out the little guide!

Cath provided us with a lovely array of breakfast and snack options and she even baked a delicious loaf of fresh bread which she left at our doorstep the following morning along with a newspaper. There is a large collection of DVD's to watch and books to read and the studio is in a quiet location with plenty parking - also within easy walking distance of public transport.

The apartment was attractively decorated and very clean with all the key amenities including coffeemaker, TV, internet, and even fresh fruit! The supermarket was conveniently around the corner, and my dad said he chatted with locals as he walked to the bakery to get bread each morning. My parents said it was like home away from home. They highly recommend Michelle as a host, and I can't wait to visit myself. Michelle, thank you for making my parents' New York trip so special. You and your family are welcome to visit us in Long Beach, CA anytime. \r\n\r\nMichelle, ist eine wunderbare und nette Gastgeberin.\r\nBei fragen und Tipps stets zur stelle und unglaublich hilfsbereit.\r\nDas Appartement ist sehr ger\u00e4umig und voll ausgestattet.\r\nDie Lage ist erstklassig, U-Bahn und Supermarkt nicht mehr als 150 Meter entfernt.\r\nWir habe uns sehr wohl gef\u00fchlt und k\u00f6nnen uns nicht beklagen.

The only thing we like to mention for the apartment that is located in a really nice area of Sydney, is that you can only reach it by bus (5 stops) - so there is no tram nearby. The last bus we were able to find to the direction of the apartment left the city at 8:30 pm. That was sometimes a little bit early for us and we had to take an uber (which costs around 20AUD). Everything else was really awesome and we can recommend to stay there for sure. Thank you Krythia for the amazing stay in Sydney."

It's a big house with 10 large bedrooms, and common livingroom and large kitchen, deck (super nice) and bathrooms (3 bathroom area with individual shower (nice one), sink and toilet). I met nice people who gave me good advices to get around Sydney. David, the host, is very responsible and responded on the post to my emails while I was there. Being large, the house is very quiet and no one really bother anyone else. A cleaner shows up everyday, they were two ladies when I was there. They do an amazing job keeping the place spotless, and they are also very sweet. Now, Coggee is an amazing place. The house is up the street from the beach- there is also a large green park next to the beach. It's really nice. I went swimming at the ladies bath (sometype of sea water swimming pool on the beach) the first morning despite being Winter: amazing! I find that the picture showing Coggee beach do not make justice. It is so much more beautiful. I can't wait to go back there. (details: bus are down the street, Sydney downtown is 25min away, the airport is 20 min away (35$ for a cab), Bondi beach is 2 beaches away :p (20min), and peroquees are all around:)"

From the spacious living areas to the modern decor, Leila's condo is located in a prime spot with spectacular views of the Pacific Ccean. After staying at her place, I wanted to highlight 4 great things about our experience: \n\n1) Resort amenities- there is a complimentary shuttle that can take you between the Ritz Carlton and Montage resorts from your villa, along with other places in the Kapalua resort. This is great, especially for trying the top rated restaurants at the resorts without having to pay for parking...plus you can have a glass (or bottle) of wine and let someone else worry about the driving :) Or you can walk!\n\n2) Accessibility- Whether you are looking to take in a nice stroll along the beach or play a round of golf, her villa is nestled right in the heart of the Kapalua Resort. Even in the rain, you can enjoy the nice pool with a covered eating area! And I need to mention that the views from her condo are breath-taking, so if you fancy a night in, hers is the place to do it!\n\n3) Her Condo- I've stayed at hotels and resorts before, but I have to say that her villa exceeds anything you can find at a high end resorts. The wi-fi was strong and fast - able to be used among multiple devices. And the entire space was so clean! We had the security of knowing that the crew didn't just do a once over and be done, but actually took the time to make sure that it was ready and prepped for us, as if no one had stayed there before us. I'm a stickler for very nice bedrooms and beds, and hers was not only comfortable, but also offered me a great night's rest after a day of beach, beach and more beach :)\n\n4) Leila & Dan - They have been a gracious host, allowing us to stay at their condo. They were quick to respond, always providing us with best in class service, and were able to provide some great recommendations on activities and events to do on the island. \n\nI want to thank you for taking the time to read my review. Our experience staying at Leila and Dan's condo was great, and we truly enjoyed the time we spent on Maui. I cannot thank them enjoy for allowing us this great and special opportunity, and for giving us a chance to experience this beautiful island in a way that like no other. For this we are very grateful! \n\nWe wish you all the best in booking your stays through AirBnb and hope you have the opportunity to stay at Leila and Dan's condo... we hope to as well very soon! \n\nMahalo!"

The kitchen has everything you need to cook. And all the bedrooms are very nice. You got even surfboards or bikes to use. We had every morning our breakfast on the porch which was always a very nice start into the day. From the house you will get in approx. 30\u201c to the ocean where you can enjoy every day the moast romantic sunsets. Its just fantastic. Puamana Ocean Breeze Bungalow is located close to Lahaina where you also find a lot of nice restaurants and grocery stores. And from Puamana you also can do realy nice daytrips like going snorkeling or do the road to Hana, to Wailea Makena or you go to Haleakala where you have a nice few on 10000 Feet over Maui (if the weather is nice) And if you just feel like relaxing than the ocean pool from Puamana is the perfect place just to calm down an enjoy the beauty of the pacific. Right in front of the club house are two surf spots where my son and daughter went surfing every morning. We just can highly recomand this beautiful place and we are still overwhelmed. Thank you so much Elise for having us. You have been always so nice and flexible and did respond very quick to our e-mails and answers. We had a realy great time and we will miss this quiet and romatic place. We just love Maui and all the other Hawaiian Islands. \nMahalo for everything. \n\nLajos and Family"

If it's to party and enjoy the nearby festivities until the wee hours of the night then this is perfect for you. I have to say that this place was a little too loud for my taste. Loud music from neighbors late at night and the busy street wasn't all that fun for an early sleeper like myself dealing with jet lag but it's out of Gwen's control so I just put my earplugs in and hoped for the best. Other than that, their place is perfectly located in safe area, and very close to the beach. Like I said it all depends on what you want out of your stay! "

The resort is very quiet and the people who live there are respectful of quiet hours. You get to meet fellow travelers and residents in the pool / jacuzzi area which is also a plus. All in all, we enjoyed our stay. Just don't forget to bring your own soap and shampoo!"

With private access it leaves you free to enjoy the environs on your own terms. The beach is a stones through away. I would love to have stayed longer.

The cabin is a renovated artist's studio at the back of the garden, secluded and private behind trees. Belinda, the host, was lovely and welcoming and gave us some advice for how to best take advantage of the natural surrounds and events that were on in town.\r\n\r\nThe amenities were clean and exactly like the photos. We were impressed with the host's taste in DVDs and books provided for our use. \r\n\r\nWe caught the ferry to Cronulla for the day ($12.60 return for an adult, must have cash to pay on the boat - a bit steep but worth it) and had a wonderful time enjoying the spring fair.\r\n\r\nAll in all, the host's made our stay extremely comfortable and gave us the privacy we needed to fully enjoy our stay.\r\n\r\nThank you Belinda and Chris!"

Joao made some very good local restaurant (many in close proximity ) recommendations too. Major Supermarket other end of beach so handy to have bikes as transport. \nEverything made available from washing machine to bedding. Massive walk in wardrobe. Hot water reliable. \nHis knowledge of Porto and provision of maps and information including travel cards was very helpful. There is a bus stop very close which takes you into the city in about 40 minutes for only \u20ac1.85. Matosinhos is a 20 minute walk away where you can pick up Metro, visit a market or eat at the many fish restaurants (fresh from fish market adjacent).\nWe made good use of the bikes and this saved us time and expense also.\nWe took the brilliant cycle way (no hills!) along the coast for about 20 km (Vila do Conde and beyond). Beaches and cafes all the way so a great escape for the day.\nUnfortunate the lift not always working but we survived and our fitness improved. \nProbably true of all apartments of any height, you do get some road noise and barking/ howling from local dogs.\nHappy to return to what became home away from home for nearly 2 weeks.\nThankyou Joao for making it possible. \n"

There is a washer and a small kitchen upstairs that you can use, and it connects to a terrace. Kamuran welcomed us when we got there and showed us our room. She's usually in the travel agency office downstairs so you can reach her easily if you need anything and get some recommendations on what to do or where to go. Word of advice, don't use their airport transfer car because it's more expensive then just getting a taxi from the airport (taxis run about 50 TL to Sultanahmed and their car transfer is 20$ which is about 72 TL ). We also had to wait 30 minutes outside the airport for the driver to pick us up. "

We have walked all over from here, the metro stop is also close. There is a small kitchen and laundry place on the roof, which was great. Also the view is beautiful. ONE small inconvenience would be the morning noises from the street, but that didn't keep us from having a great stay here.

During our stay it was very hot in Istanbul so air-conditioning was a life saviour. For all the questions we had about where to go and how to get we got the most detailed explanation,me and my boyfriend couldn't imagine best host then that. All the problems you might possibly have with the room will be solved in a blink of an eye! Location was more then just great, Sultanahmet is the best district to have all the points of interest around you, Hagia Sofia 10min,Blue mosque 7 min ,tram station 8min,lots of place to eat around, only be weary Turkish people(sellers/restaurants) cheat the whole time ,don't order a beer in the restaurant without asking the price ,don't pick up a brush from the shoe cleaning man when he dropped it,in Istanbul is a lot of scam is going on!"

We appreciated the convenience of the dishwasher and washer and dryer.  The grounds themselves are perfectly manicured and have many bbq grills which we used on several occasions.  The grounds are very clean and the bbq grills themselves are cleaned by the apartment complex's maintenance crew.  The grounds are right on the edge of a shore (not exactly a beach that one would go to for swimming and lounging) that provide stunning views of the water and sunset.\r\n\r\nThis apartment is a great value in that you are centrally located among different sights such as Wailea Beach and Lahaina (a 15-30 minute drive).  We would recommend renting a car so that you can drive around the island.  Very few sights would be easily accessible to you otherwise.  There are also a full bathroom for each bedroom, so you have a 2-bedroom, 2-bath apartment.  The master bedroom has a lanai the provides a good view of the island.  The second bedroom's window looks out into the dark hallway of the apartment floor though.  A free parking spot was provided for the unit, which was convenient for our rental car.  There is also a balcony off of the kitchen that provides you with a great view of the water.\r\n\r\nOverall, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this unit!"

The place is very clean, has a bunch of amenities, and also has some beach accessories. We came as a couple but we able to make a couple breakfast meals and just relax instead of always having to go to a restaurant. It is about 45 minutes from the airport but is only 20 minutes from the main town of Lahaina (which is great to walk around, shop, and eat) and 10 minutes from kanapali which has a lot of great restaurants and shopping. If I were to come back to Maui I would stay in this same area! \nDonell has been fantastic, accommodating, and very open to offering advice and tips. We thank her very much for her help! \nMahalo! "

Just before his place, you can identify a small restaurant and a small grocery store. \n\nAli is such a great host with distinguished Turkish hospitality. He helped me several times to locate appropriate places for buying gifts.

                "txt": "This place is great. It's a small studio unit in a neighborhood/apartment complex like area. There is a washer dryer on property. It costs $1 to wash and about $1 to dry clothes. \r\n\r\nThe kitchen is stocked with pots, pans, and dishes. The fridge worked great. A short drive away from Napili Plaza that has a grocery store, coffee shop, a good taco place, and a pharmacy. Also there is a shop there that has snorkel gear for rent. You will need this to swim with the sea turtles. \r\n\r\nThe unit does not have air conditioning. I kept the sliding glass door open while I slept to keep the air circulating. Also the front door has a gate that you can lock while keeping the front door open. However some moths and the ocassional mosquito can get in. There is a screen on the sliding glass door in the back and a privacy shade that you can pull down. \r\n\r\nYou can walk to the Napili bay beach from the condo, about 10 mins, it's better than trying to find parking. There is a weird beeping noise right outside the bathroom window. You can hear it very clearly from the bed at night. This was distracting sometimes as I am a writer so it was hard to focus. I did most of my writing at the coffee shop which as described does have Wi-Fi and is very good. \r\n\r\nThere are two beach towels in the closet and a mini cooler for the beach. The condo unit is small, so there is no living space to hang out. But most of your day you will be out and about or at the beach all day. So you really only need this place for some cooking and sleeping. \r\n\r\nI did not use the TV. I turned it on once and couldn't figure out the cable so I didn't bother with it. The host is very helpful, just text if you need anything. \r\n\r\nThere is a specific parking spot. Use the parking decal provided and stay in that spot. The trash is located at the entrance to the property. I did not check out the pool area as the beach was amazing and took up all my time. Also 5 mins away from Spa Montage. If you get a day pass for $55 you can hang out at the spa all day between the pool, hot tubs, and hydrocircuit.  It was a fun way for me to kill half a day and read in the relaxation lounge. \r\n\r\nFrom Lahaina harbor you can get day trips on a ferry over to lanai or Molokai islands as well. I heard the snorkeling at Kaanapali was a little clearer, but I noticed the currents were much stronger there. I prefer Napili bay. Give the shower pull thing a jiggle if it doesn't make the water go all the way up."

Checking in was simple and we arrived to a lovely bottle of bubbles! The view and location are absolutely unbeatable, and the apartment is terrific. The photos do not do justice - it's an amazing apartment! Great lighting, very comfortable, and well furnished. The flat has all the amenities you need and truly makes you feel at home.  \r\n\r\nWe had a very small issue with the internet dropping out periodically but Kate went above and beyond to ensure things were fixed.  And\u2026 left us another bottle of bubbles for our troubles, which was so incredibly nice!\r\n\r\nThe apartment was a short walk to Bondi, Bronte and Coogee beaches.  The walk from Tamarama to Bondi is breathtaking.  We were lucky enough to catch the Sculptures by the Sea the week of our stay.\r\n\r\nOur experience was outstanding and highly recommend Wayne and Kate\u2019s place. We did not want to leave! We look forward to staying at Wayne and Kate\u2019s in the future. Thanks again for everything, Wayne and Kate!  :)\r\n"

Not that you need to leave Williamsburg, we had some of the best food and drinks there during our NY visit! Ade's place is clean, with an eclectic decor, it's comfortable and surprisingly quiet. Communication with Ade was easy, and everything went very smoothly over our week-long stay. Thanks again for having us, Ade :)"

Some rooms (at the front) were very hot if the doors were closed come morning time. However, seeing as most of us were out (not home) doing activities during the hot days, the nights were cool enough to open the windows, and Zoe provided a few fans, so it was manageable.

Even though it's on street level, the street is a quiet / residential one, and the entrance is some distance from the sidewalk\u2014so noise is not an issue. There are very nice restaurants and cafes less than a block or two away. Ildiko went the extra mile in stocking the apartment with essential items, including a fully stocked first-aid kit(!). Although I had office space in Manhattan, I spent all of my time working from home, because I didn't want to leave the house or this neighborhood. Prospect Park is also very close, which makes for a nice place to go for a walk and clear the mind. Definitely one of the nicest and most pleasant airbnb experiences I've had so far!"

                "txt": "This is a great little apartment on a quiet tree-lined street about two and a half blocks from the beach.  It is close to everything including the Siqueira Campos Metro stop which is a big plus if you need to get to downtown Rio. There are parts of Copacabana that are quite a trek from the Metro. There are all sorts of restaurants within a block in all directions and of course the beach a 5-minute walk away.\r\n\r\nEverything is brand new and the apartment feels modern and cozy at the same time. It is however quite small. I was there by myself for 4 nights and it was perfect. Great for a couple as well if you get along really well. I wouldn't try to put 3 people in this place. When the bed is unfolded there is very little floor space left. The little space there is actually feels a lot bigger because it is very organized. It is easy to keep tidy since there is really only one place to put each thing. The handy apartment guide shows you where things go, how to unfold the sofa into the various configurations, and has some tips on the area. \r\n\r\nThere is both wired and wireless Internet which was fast and worked perfectly for me. There is a nice little flat screen TV with satellite channels and easily accessible hdmi ports so you can hook up your laptop and play your own content. Sometimes wall-mounted flat screens make it really hard to get to the hdmi ports, but not in this case.\r\n\r\nNote that power outlets in Brazil come in about 4 different flavours and you can never really be sure whether it is 110V or 220V. So bring adapters and make sure anything you plug in won't be fried by being plugged into a 220V outlet. In this apartment all (and there are surprisingly many) the outlets are IEC-906-1 type plugs at 220V. It is 3-pronged but still 2-prong Europlug compatible so if you are coming from most of Europe you won't need adapters. If you are coming from North America, bring some regular US-Euro adapters.\r\n\r\nThe view of Cristo Redentor (Christ the Redeemer statue) is especially nice at sunset and in the evening when it is lit up. There is a shot of it at sunset taken from the window of the apartment here: (Website hidden by Airbnb) \r\n\r\nAlan and Catherine were lightning quick to respond and made the process extremely smooth.\r\n\r\nAll in all this was a perfect and relaxing 4 nights in Copacabana for me."

The creative design and artistic details are inspiringly put together. It is also wonderful because it is situated in the heart of Copa. Very close to the shops, the beach, the metro, and major tourist attractions. Location and design are the perfect combo to make your stay comfortable and rewarding!\r\n\r\nAlan is such a kind, polite and thoughtful person! I will not forget his kindness. He went above and beyond to make my stay a happy one. In fact, he went well and beyond my expectations of a land lord. He even helped me organise a taxi to leave and booked it for me. Alan also arranged to get the apartment cleaned mid-stay. I did not ask him to do this. In sum, you could not want nicer person to deal with! Alan is a rare gem! He responds to emails in a timely manner and is a generous, helpful and wonderful!  He thinks of everything to make your stay a happy one!\r\n\r\nThe apartment building is nice and the couple that work at the door and look after the cleaning are such warm, kind and beautiful Brazilian people!!! They helped me so much with many things. When I arrived my luggage was missing, so they rang the airport and even offered to drive me to the airport! They even helped me go shopping for electrical goods so I could use my computer. Outstanding kindness!!!  It was a joy to come and home and say hello to them on the way to the elevator. I will miss them very much!\r\n\r\nThe apartment is comfortable because every last detail has been very well considered. Coming from Australia, I found the internet speed very fast and easy to connect. The cable TV is excellent and nice to watch after a long day touring Rio! The kitchen is perfect and is a delightful place to make yummy breakfast etc. The bathroom is very well designed. While the living room and bedroom is a joy to be in due to the artwork and beautiful use of form and light. The use of colour in the studio is visually sophisticated and joyful. I really loved the use of design to create atmosphere and mixed with Brazilian art, this is a real treat to enjoy! Loved it!!!\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed dealing with Alan and Catherine. They are perfect hosts and I will be coming back to stay again for sure! Thank you so much Alan and Catherine for letting me stay in your beautiful home. I had the best time and will always remember how lovely your home and your wonderful kindness! \r\n\r\nThank you!!!!!! "

He also sent us a PDF guide with lots of pages on tips for restaurants, beaches, snorkeling, driving adventures etc. A lot of them we followed.\n\nThe apartment itself is exactly as advertised. Comfortable, well equipped with all the essential kitchen appliances and accessories. Air conditioning in the main living room, and portable air conditioning in the bedroom which worked a treat during our stay. The added extras such as beach chairs, beach mats and a drinks/food cooler was very much appreciated, and used every day. Parking is right at the front and easy to access. \n\nThe location is to die for. Having explored every part of this amazing Island we agreed that our favourite location was Kikei. The locals were very friendly, access to restaurants and supermarkets was just minutes away, and many of the Island learn to surf clinics (highly recommend doing this!) were run from a beach 5 minutes walk along the street. Every day we swam with turtles at the beaches immediately in the area of the apartment. You can literally walk out of the apartment, across the road and watch the sunset over the ocean every day. Amazing!\n\nI highly recommend this apartment and Thomas as a host."

(even the curtains). \r\n\r\nI've to commend the room's cleanliness. One of the first few things that I noticed about the room when I stepped in was its clean floor- spick and span, I did not spot clumps of hair or the floor being covered in dust- that was one of the strengths of the room. \r\n\r\nSecondly, the toilet's floor was clean and there was no hair lying about the floor, or murky stains spotted about the toilet (not that I dared inspect every corner dilligently- but I stepped into the toilet barefooted, assured that it was clean)\r\n\r\nThey only provide basic body foam and shampoo, which are put into wall dispensers. I found the body soap to suffice but the shampoo was abit drying and so you might want to bring your own shampoo perhaps. \r\n\r\nCleanliness-wise, I give the sleeping area room + the toilets a 3.5 / 5 stars as I did not spot any dirt that irked me, the floors were clean enough to walk barefoot and they looked without dust. \r\nPerhaps, the only area which I did not walk barefoot much on was the doorway area as we were wearing shoes in and walking on it, during our first day. \r\n\r\nSpace-wise, it may be small, but mangeable for 2 people. I would say that it is just nice- roomy for 1 pax but just nice- slightly tight (depending on how spacey a room you are used to) for 2 people. Hong Kong is known for small room sizes though, so I thought this small room space is common.\r\nThe toilet is quite small though, and the places to hang your clothes/towels might not be as luxurious as hotels but we managed alright ultimately. There's not much space to move in the toilet. But its cleanliness and the reasonable price topped the space constraints! Bedroom wise , space is alright for 2 people.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, the room window was the only difficult thing managing as it was abit hard closing it and some slight dust.\r\n\r\nTowels and linen smelt fresh! Bedsheets felt clean!\r\nYou need to request for towels. \r\nHost was very obliging, VERY, in answering all my many questions! I emailed her TONS. \r\nKeith & Joey were on duty when we were there and both are helpful, obliging people. Joey was very friendly and helped us to check which Karaoke places were cheap and the night bus to the airport! Their guesthouse is quite systematic I feel, with either Keith or Joey(lu xiao jie) on duty at different times of the day and they give you the number to call them with a phone hung outside the reception door. \r\nKeith answered any questions we had too! \r\nThey even provided us a SIM card with internet!\r\nTHANK YOU Athena, Keith&Joey! \r\nFor this price&cleanliness, it's worth.\r\n"

Her apartment is nothing short of amazing.  It is a great size for Hong Kong, incredibly comfortable, spotlessly clean and elegantly furnished.  The apartment is an an oasis from the hustle & bustle of Hong Kong.  It is perfectly situated on Hollywood Road, in the thick of a great selection of restaurants & bars and parks and is walking distance to Central & SOHO.  The apartment is open and airy, filled with natural light and is perfect for the business person that needs space to work out of or just to have a breather from the Hong Kong pace (a real luxury for Hong Kong).  The rooftop garden is a real bonus.  What a wonderful and unique experience.  I highly recommend this to any business person and discerning traveller.  I hope to return there soon.  Thanks Barbara! :-)"

Really enjoyed the neighborhood - it was fairly quiet at night, but just a few blocks to walk to the shops and restaurants along Hollywood Road (the art/artisan shops at PMQ were our favorite). The kitchen is well equipped and there are two grocery markets within a few minutes walk (one Chinese-style and one English-style), so it was easy to make breakfast each morning, open up the balcony doors, and listen to the birds chirping in the park across the street. Barbara was very helpful with suggestions on dinner places - she gave us 6 suggestions within a 5 minute walk; we made it to 5 and had a great meal each time. The Sheung Wan area is very convenient to Central and it's easy to pick up taxis, trams, and the MTR within a few blocks of the apartment to get anywhere in the city. We'd definitely book Barbara's place again if we return to Hong Kong."

The spatial arrangement of the house, which I speculate would have been built in the 50s or 60s, is great: two bedrooms are in the first floor, luminous but protected from direct exposure to sunlight, excellent for peaceful sleep. A spacious and nicely decorated living room upstairs boasts a commanding view of the garden, the sea, and the neighboring island (Heybeliada). The living room connects to a kitchen and a balcony overlooking the garden where we enjoyed our meals. The garden was my favorite spot. It is not for those who love neatly arranged, engineered, and regularly maintained gardens. Sanem\u00b4s is an essentially picturesque garden with wild plants that look like being there for ages. There are regularized pockets where Sanem has planted tomatoes, cucumbers, and green peppers. I loved watering them. She graciously let us taste mulberries and plums. Four different plum trees, two different mulberry trees, a cherry tree, a sour cherry tree, fig tree, vines, roses, loquat, and of course the sublime pine tree partly covered by a delightful bougainvillea... Yes, this is still considered to be Istanbul. The notorious phaeton noises and manure smells of B\u00fcy\u00fckada stay away from this house. We only smelt flowers and post-rain soil, and heard beautiful seagulls whose concert sabotaged occasionally by gangs of crows plotting to take plums and mulberries away... Despite all its peacefulness, the house is not completely isolated: there are two small groceries and a restaurant just about fifty meters down the street. Sanem is a lovely person. She met us at the check-in, made sure we had a pleasant stay, and encouraged us to contact her anytime should there be any inconvenience, which never happened. Great house, dream garden.  "

When we started our family, it was no longer practical to stay in hotels with limited space, compromise security with two separate hotel rooms and incur the food and beverage costs of our growing children. As business travelers we have had the opportunity to visit some of the most amazing cities but none of these locations have come close to the feeling of peace and serenity that we have found in Wailea. Grand Champions Villas is hands down the greatest value in all of Wailea. The central location, beautifully maintained grounds, security and space within the villas cannot be beat. The villa is perfected by a truly beautiful interior with a fresh, relaxing vibe. It was our goal to bring the beauty we saw in the grounds of Wailea to the interior of the villa where we spend time with our family creating cherished memories. We would love to share this magical place with you. Hula On In to Beach House Chic Style. With warmest aloha, Paul",

The kitchen was stocked with all the cutley, dishes and pots and pans we could need throughout our stay and dishwasher pods so we didn't have to take time away from vacationing :) The owners also provided us with plenty or towels and beach towels, and other amenities such as a blow dryer. Besides the beaches, I didn't feel that there was too much to do in the close vicinity, but I was still happy with the location as we had plenty of activities planned all over the island, and Waliea-Makena ended up being a relatively central point. I would definitely recommend this condo when your visiting Maui! Aloha :)"

He personally greeted me warmly with a comforting plate of Italian pasta with kidney beans and smoked cheese. It was quite good. He gave me all the subway info I needed easily, and all his info was accurate. As if this guy hadn't done more than enough already, he ended up giving me a pair of tennis shoes bc my luggage didn't make it and I had no shoes suitable for walking the streets of NY. This place is awesome. You should consider yourself lucky if he has an opening for you.\n"

Appeared that host is not the actual home owner but rather part of a management company - not relevant for appartment. Kitchen had all utensils required but no basics such as sugar,salt etc. Good space in the appartment for a group and a great sitting room.

The ORM was born of the combination of the main passions of its founders: the city of Porto and its cultural characteristics; the architecture and decoration; the gastronomy and photography and, above all, the contact with different cultures.\r\n\r\nThe project is based on the support and guidance of property owners located in the center of the city who want to direct their homes to the tourism market.\r\n\r\nIt also involves the design and decoration of these same spaces, giving them a unique identity that translates into the extremely positive reaction of our guests.\r\nOur project culminates in the total management of the property, which includes the organization and preparation of these spaces for the tourist rental.\r\nSo with our dedication and daily work we have been able to please our guests who show the highest intention of repeating their experiences with our team. \r\nIn addition, besides the management, we are responsible for the constant guests' contact and that we privelege the personalized accompaniment - what distinguishes us and allows us a greater proximity to the diverse cultures.\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nQuatro amigos, muitos sonhos, um caminho em comum\r\n\r\nOporto Rental Management surgiu em 2015 pela vontade de quatro jovens amigos: a Rosa, a T\u00e2nia, o Igor e o Nuno.

It was the basement of their home with a lot of space and a half bathroom. Really relaxing experience with all the privacy you want, a large TV with Netflix and Amazon  for those who like to watch a nice movie when coming back from a long day in New York. The photos on airbnb are not really capturing how nicely decorated and well kept is the room. Nothing compared to other rooms I have seen in Astoria. The towels provided are of very good quality and very large, the wi-fi works perfectly and there is plenty of space for your things. To me and after seeing a lot of rooms, there is no doubt that this one is the best taking into consideration the space provided, the location and the price asked!\r\nThe neighborhood was again really pretty. Very safe with lots of shops for food and interesting markets. I had the feeling and really wanted to go back to Astoria and walk around after a busy day in Manhattan. 4min walk to 30th station and 16 min ride to Lex avenue and the upper east side which in my opinion is the best area in NY \r\nI can't say enough about Gabe and his mum. Their hospitality was awesome! I was welcomed with a lot of snacks, fruits and a bottle of wine waiting for me when I arrived and kept coming during my stay. Gabe was answering immediately to all my texts and tried to sort out anything I needed in order to feel more at home! But besides that the most important thing is that both of them are very interesting and well educated people. You can have a lot of discussions about lots of things and learn, which at least for me is very important! I think I made some friends in NYC, which by the way is a truly amazing city.\r\nHighly recommended, no need to look anywhere else! Thanks a lot guys."

I keep a good home but Gabe clearly has a future career as interior decorator awaiting him.\r\n3) Plants! There's a garden of greenery spread around the apt.\r\n4) Everything useful is labeled, from the lightswitches to the recycling bin.\r\n5) There is a pre-sentient voice-activated music player in the living room. \"Alexa play some Jazz\". \"Alexa louder\". \"Alexa next\".

I have no cockroaches etc and ask that drains remain covered to ensure my home remains this way. 2. Walter filter. Water is drinkable from the tap. If you choose to use the filter - please ensure it is only filtered with COLD water. The hot water ruins the filter. 3. Hot water: please leave OFF when not in use - prevents high power costs. It is electric so it'll need 3-5 minutes to hear prior to a shower  4: When going out for the day, or leaving, please ensure the following is turned off: water heater, air-conditioners, lights & coffee machine. (& sink holes closed/covered) 5. When leaving, please ensure the door is locked (seems crazy, but many forget this!)",

Currently two of our three grown-up children live with us and we have a spare room. We have always had guests in our house since the children were very little and it is something that we would like to continue doing as I believe connecting with other people and learning about different cultures is wonderful. \r\nWe love film, food, travel and music. This is a very musical household. Sport is also a very big thing- you will always find somebody watching the tennis/cricket/football on the television or going for a wok or bike ride. \r\nWe ourselves love Airbnb and have used it all over the world in recent years. In Canada, France, South America and of course all around here in Australia. \r\nMy life motto: you could die tomorrow so live life to the full! ",

Os funcion\u00e1rios do pr\u00e9dio s\u00e3o simp\u00e1ticos e, quando tivemos uma pequena reclama\u00e7\u00e3o de barulho em rela\u00e7\u00e3o a um vizinho, o porteiro rapidamente resolveu-o, sem sequer ser necess\u00e1rio fazermos contato com a anfitri\u00e3 a respeito. S\u00f3 sentimos que uma parte da cozinha n\u00e3o condiz com o restante do apartamento, mas penso que a anfitri\u00e3 dever\u00e1 resolver isso em breve. O banho de chuveiro \u00e9 excelente, os eletrodom\u00e9sticos da cozinha e a m\u00e1quina de lavar-secar s\u00e3o novos e muito bons, a ilumina\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 linda e o ar condicionado no quarto \u00e9 bastante potente (talvez o suficiente para refrigerar o apartamento inteiro, mas n\u00e3o h\u00e1 como isolar a casa da \u00e1rea de servi\u00e7o com tanque, que \u00e9 aberta). Acabamos n\u00e3o conhecendo a Sonia, pois chegamos e sa\u00edmos em hor\u00e1rios inusuais, mas a chegada e a sa\u00edda foram tranquilas mesmo assim e o contato (por (Hidden by Airbnb) ) correu de forma fluida e sempre que necess\u00e1rio (de ambas partes). Ficar\u00edamos aqui de novo e recomendamos para quem queira um apartamento de quarto e sala confort\u00e1vel numa zona agrad\u00e1vel, central e n\u00e3o cara do Rio de Janeiro."

Nous avons ador\u00e9 la pierre que la propri\u00e9taire a sauvegard\u00e9e sous les fen\u00eatres et autour des portes et les volets typiques \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur. La d\u00e9coration est tr\u00e8s soign\u00e9e. L\u00e0 aussi, un mix d\u2019objets tr\u00e8s design, comme la superbe lampe dans la cuisine ou dans le salon et des petits meubles vintage un peu partout, tr\u00e8s beaux. La cuisine est un bonheur. On pouvait prendre notre petit d\u00e9jeuner sur la terrasse qui donne sur un petit jardin adorable o\u00f9 l\u2019on peut descendre par un large escalier. Nous avions un grand choix de vaisselle magnifique. Les chambres sont aussi tr\u00e8s confortables. Chacune avait sa salle de bains. Mais le must, c\u2019est les draps. Nous avons eu l\u2019impression de dormir dans un h\u00f4tel 5 \u00e9toiles. Douillets et soyeux \u00e0 souhait. J\u2019aimerais avoir les m\u00eames chez moi ! La biblioth\u00e8que du salon contient plein de livres int\u00e9ressants et une bonne collection de dvd. On s\u2019est senti chez nous, avec un certain luxe en plus ! C\u2019est s\u00fbr, nous reviendrons \u00e0 Porto et dans cette maison qui nous a touch\u00e9s. Le s\u00e9jour \u00e9tait trop court, comme toujours\u2026"

Regardless he was there waiting for us and gave us a thorough explanation of the apartment, location and sites for us to visit.\r\n\r\nWe are a family of two adults and two children. The apartment is not really optimal for small children, because of the rickety staircase. But we made due with the sleeping arrangements on the first floor and had a great time.\r\n\r\nThe apartment is small but very nicely decorated and was exactly as described. The location is great. Just next to the Ponte Lu\u00eds I bridge and the riverside restaurants. The apartment faces away from the water but this allows for a small terrace facing toward the cliff side, which was very nice for a spot of air. \r\n\r\nHugo also has a deal with a breakfast delivery service, whom left a beautiful basket outside our door. The service also catered to Hugos high service standard and replaced the coffee in our basket with chocolate milk, which was immensely more popular with our children.\r\n\r\nI can only give my best recommendation to both Hugo and the apartment. It is a beautiful space in a prime location at a semi affordable rate. We only gave slightly more than we would have paid for a cheap hotel and half of what we would have paid at a nice one."

Judy was very nice and welcoming, providing a supply of breakfast staples as well as great hints about neighborhood cafes and restaurants.  My mother - always apprehensive about parking - was especially pleased that there is lots of free on-street parking available in the surrounding neighborhood.  Judy was easy to correspond with in advance and to connect with the day they arrived - she's very responsive, and even let me preview the space to ensure it would be accessible for my older parents.

You can walk down Atlantic Avenue or State to get to Brooklyn Bridge Park (which is quite lovely!).  It's about a 10 minute walk.

The neighborhood is truly in the fashion of a Bohemian San Francisco with steep winding streets and many excellent restaurants, flea markets,and designer shops all near by.\r\nThe best surprise of all was the the fantastic roof patio where one can sit and see the beautiful views of the Golden Horn and the Blue Mosque in the distance.\r\nThe rooms are airy and light with tall ceilings, and her personally designed cabinets and interior ,had such a simple elegant feel.\r\nThe separate bedroom is extremely cool in the summer and relaxing ,which has a view to the back over a tree covered 400 year old Hamam .The combined call to prayer and  the sound of many birds is positively magic. \r\nI highly recommend this Flat\r\nMichael Schmitt \r\nSanta Barbara California "

Tudo que conquistei foi gra\u00e7as ao sucesso no Airbnb!\r\n\r\nMinha experi\u00eancia come\u00e7ou quando recebi um flat da minha av\u00f3 atrav\u00e9s de heran\u00e7a (em vida!!), investi pesado na reforma do apartamento para poder oferecer o maior conforto poss\u00edvel aos meus h\u00f3spedes. Comecei a administrar seu aluguel e o sucesso foi t\u00e3o grande que mudou a minha vida!\r\n\r\nMeus amigos e familiares viram como o meu \u201cneg\u00f3cio\u201d estava dando certo e come\u00e7aram a pedir para que eu tamb\u00e9m administrasse o aluguel dos apartamentos deles (nessa \u00e9poca ainda n\u00e3o existia a figura do co-host). \r\n\r\nTopei o desafio e o n\u00famero de apartamentos foi se multiplicando! O resultado foi \u00f3timo e percebi que me sentia muito realizado com as experi\u00eancias que estava ganhando como empreendedor e ao conhecer pessoas de tantos lugares do mundo! De tal maneira que decidi largar meu emprego como gestor em marketing para me dedicar exclusivamente a voc\u00eas!\r\n\r\nFiz um curso de guia de turismo para ter mais conhecimento sobre a cidade e abri a All in Rio, uma Ag\u00eancia de Turismo que oferece tours culturais, naturais e de aventura, al\u00e9m do aluguel de apartamentos de temporada.\r\n\r\nMeu objetivo \u00e9 oferecer uma estadia segura, confort\u00e1vel e poder fornecer todas as informa\u00e7\u00f5es necess\u00e1rias para voc\u00ea desfrutar ao m\u00e1ximo a sua experi\u00eancia em nossa cidade maravilhosa! \r\n\r\nObrigado pela aten\u00e7\u00e3o!\r\n\r\nFabio\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nHi!\r\n\r\nI've been on Airbnb since 2011 and I\u2019m a big fan of the Platform. All I got was thanks to my success on Airbnb!\r\n\r\nMy experience began when I received a flat from my grandmother through inheritance (in life!!). I invested heavily in the renovation of the apartment to be able to offer the greatest comfort possible to my guests. I started managing the rent and the success was so amazing that it changed my life!\r\n\r\nMy friends and family noticed how well my \"business\" was going and started to ask me to manage their apartment\u2019s rent too (at the time, the figure of  the co-host didn\u2019t exist).\r\n\r\nI accepted the challenge and the number of apartments was multiplying! The result was great and I realized that I felt very fulfilled with the experiences I was gaining as an entrepreneur and by meeting people from so many places in the world! So I decided to leave my job as a marketing manager to dedicate myself exclusively to you!\r\n\r\nI took a tour guide course to gain more knowledge about the city and opened the All in Rio, a Tourism Agency that offers cultural, natural and adventure tours, as well as apartments for seasonal rents.\r\n\r\nMy goal is to offer you a safe and comfortable stay and to be able to provide all the information necessary so you can enjoy your experience in our wonderful city to the fullest!\r\n\r\nThank you for your time!\r\n\r\nFabio\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nComments from my guests:\r\n\r\n\u201cThis apartment is in the most amazing location. Leblon is beautiful, safe, and packed with fabulous restaurants. The apartment is just by the ocean - couldn't really be better. Communicating with Fabio was super-easy.

The water was hot, the wi-fi worked perfectly. The only negative that I had about the room was the noise. \r\n\r\nThe unit is situated on the 2nd floor of the building right outside a busy street. Every night around midnight, two bars would open up across the and start blaring music. The music would not stop until 8am the next morning. I ended up having to buy a white noise machine just to last through the night.\r\n\r\nThe only other feedback I had was around Fabio, the host. All of the reviews mentioned how responsive and helpful he was. However that was not the case for me. The day I booked, I couldn't get him to respond to the booking. I even had to have AirBnB call him. And then I asked him about touring the city. Instead of offering, he pointed me to a few self serve options. When I asked again, he said he would plan a trip then never responded. When I responded to him, he said he was too busy and my trip was over. \r\n\r\nFabio being my tour guide is not a huge requirement, but I had thought he would be more willing (or suggest someone), given the feedback people had for him o this site.\r\n\r\nAll in all, great place if you don't mind the noise and don't need a helpful host.

The view of course is unbeatable. If this unit were any closer to the ocean, it would have fish in it. It's in a smaller complex, with nobody above you. \r\n\r\nThe neighborhood is okay; appeared to be safe, and there are some eating/shopping options close by, but most restaurants and shops you may want to go to are a little further afield, but not more than a 3-5 minute drive (Kaanapali itself is about 10 minutes away, which is a good thing in my opinion). The road the complex is on is fairly busy, but not too noisy (most cars are going pretty slow here), see more below.\r\n\r\nThe complex itself is pretty old but appeared to be very well-maintained. There's a small beach adjacent to the complex that's okay for recreational bathing but not a destination in itself. The overall vibe was very private and intimate; a very friendly atmosphere. The pool was a huge added bonus for us; the kids wanted to use it practically every day. Honokowai Park was on the other side of the complex; we didn't go here, but the recon I did on a walk gave me the impression that the park was okay but nothing to write home about.\r\n\r\nThe overall noise level here was very minimal; no loud guests or screaming kids. There is some road noise in the front bedroom, and although I wasn't in that bedroom, it wouldn't have bugged me, and I'm a light sleeper. \r\n\r\nThe baths were very nice and almost resort-y; overall, they were very clean although the grout could use a good cleaning, just saying. The kitchen was more than adequate for our needs, and had quite a bit of storage space. We also used the barbecues on premise a couple of times; they're impeccably maintained.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that is a drawback to this place in my opinion is that the loft can get quite stuffy, even with the fans going full blast. We were there in August, and several nights up there were fine, some others were uncomfortable, and there was 2 nights where it was extremely hard to sleep up there.\r\n\r\nSo overall, this place is perfect if you value a tranquil atmosphere with a killer view, in a nice unit in a pleasant complex, at a fair price. If you have enough guests to where you have to utilize the loft, the weather may be a roll of the dice as to how comfortable it is."

Susann and Alessandra were extremely thorough, with an extensive helpbook provided to cover all your needs from dry cleaning to police to food.

Eine unglaublich sympathische und unterhaltsame Dame, die ich sehr schnell ins Herz geschlossen habe. Sonntags sind wir zusammen zum Bio Bazar gelaufen und an einigen Tagen kochen wir sogar was zusammen.  Mein Zimmer befindet sich im obersten Stock, wo ich komplett meine Ruhe habe. gegen\u00fcber von meinem Zimmer ist eine wundersch\u00f6ne Terasse, die zum Yoga machen oder ein Buch lesen einl\u00e4dt. G\u00e4ste sind auch immer willkommen. Fatma hat ihre eigenen Stil, welches dem ganzen Haus, bis auf den Eingangsbereich, einen unglaublichen charm gibt. Jedes Zimmer ist individuell und man muss sagen, dass bis her die Leute, die ich im Haus kennengelernt habe, echt toll sind. Wenn man sich f\u00fcr Fatma entscheidet, sollte man auf alle F\u00e4lle kulturoffen sein und sich diesem sch\u00f6nen antiken Stil und der Nostalgie einfach fallen lassen. Ich bin durch Fatma und durch die Wohnung in einem alten Istanbul angekommen und f\u00fchle mich super wohl. Zu meiner Arbeit in Cihangir laufe ich t\u00e4glich zu Fu\u00df. Die Lage ist sehr perfekt. Ich brauche kaum Bus oder Bahn zu benutzen, da ich alles in Beyoglu und Taksim finde, was ich brauche. Nur f\u00fcr meine Touristentour habe ich lediglich die Bahn benutzt. Obwohl man zum Emin\u00f6nu auch zu Fu\u00df laufen kann, wenn man spazieren gehen mag. Ich danke Dir, Fatma abla, so wie ich dich gerne zu nennen pflege, f\u00fcr Deine Offenheit und Deine W\u00e4rme. Ich werde Dich sehr bald wieder besuchen kommen und hoffentlich sogar mein altes Zimmer beziehen im obersten Stock. "

The location is wonderful: it's easy to get anywhere by foot, taxi, bus, dolmus, metro or boat.\nFatma, who lives there, and her daughter Elvan, who lives in Italy but is quick to communicate by email, are extremely friendly and helpful. \nFatma also cooks wonderfully and even offers cooking classes. \nI would definitely recommend staying there, for three nights or three months, and hope to stay there again myself.\nBe aware though that if you have respiratory issues, this might not be a good choice as there is a fair amount of smoking happening inside, and even the neighbourhood is quite smoky because of the coal heating."

The house is great, very typical and nice - as a bonus, the bathrooms were all renovated and they look fantastic. The terrace made for many evenings relaxing away from the hustle and bustle of Istiklal St. In terms of location, the house is in a great spot: seconds away from Istiklal, minutes from Taksim and the cool Cihangir area, and a short train ride or longer walk to Sultanahmet, Topkapi and all the tourist sites.

Its ideal location in North Kihei is close to restaurants, many beaches, and interesting activities. From your lanai, you will see an ancient Hawaiian fish pond where green sea turtles sometimes come to bask; there is a quiet, shaded park, the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary (the only sanctuary dedicated to to humpback whales), and an awesome Indian restaurant right on the ocean. Located near the beginning of the longest uninterrupted white sand beach in the whole state, you can run (or walk) from our unit all the way (six miles -in front of Kihei Canoe Club, Maui Canoe Club and a few condos to the protected area along the Kealia Pond National Wildlife Refuge and board walk) to Maalaea Harbor (with the excellent Maui Ocean Center, Maui Golf & Sports park for the kids, many restaurants, Pacific Whale Foundation - and a bus stop to deliver you back in front of Kihei Bay Surf. Our complex has a good swimming pool, hot jacuzzi, tennis courts, BBQ area, and clean laundry facilities. \r\n\r\nOur corner unit is bigger and has more light than most of the other units in our complex. The wrap-around lanai offers more space than the other units as well. It has a queen bed and a sofa couch for sleeping. The unit has been renovated and upgraded several times since my mom first lived there when she arrived on Maui from Chicago in 1985 to teach English at Maui College. She loved her job and Kihei -- and she met a nice, handsome counsellor working at the college. They got married - and had me. \r\n\r\nAnd I just got married in August to my beautiful bride, who has a 8-year-old son. We feel very blessed. And we hope to share our love of place with you. \r\n\r\nAt KBS, you will be close to Kihei Canoe Club, where both my mom and I have done competitive outrigger canoe paddling. You can experience being out on the water if you go to the KCC Visitor Paddle on Tuesday or Thursday morning. Get there by 7:15 am to make sure you get a spot. During the winter, you may see whales while you are on the water. Allow a couple of hours for the experience. My mom is a volunteer for the HIHWNMS - the free museum and whale sanctuary across the street. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, you can hear a free lecture from 11am until noon about the Humpback Whales. The museum is open from 10am-3pm, Monday-Friday, and on the last Saturday of the month from 10am-1pm. The mission is to educate the public and protect humpback whales and other marine life and our environment. \r\n\r\nAnother activity that is nearby is Hawaiian singing, ukulele, and hula on Thursday nights from 7-8:30 pm. at the Keolahou Church, 177 S. Kihei Rd. It is joyful - and a glimpse of Hawaiian culture. \r\n\r\nCome stay. We think you will have a wonderful time.",

To the right is the ocean and to the left is toward Ipanema beach.  The beds are cozy, the kitchen is stocked to cook in, the front room is a relaxing place to watch movies (or, in our case, Olympic highlights).  The neighborhood below has a grocery store, pharmacy, restaurants, juice bars, a gym, yoga...anything a traveler could need.  It is a 1 and a 1/2 block walk to Copacabana Beach and a short walk to Ipanema.  We could not have asked for a better place to stay, or for a kinder, more gracious host.  Ricardo helped us with Uber, shopping, bike rentals, getting money exchanged, what sites to see, and had some nice surprises upon our arrival.  Thank you, Ricardo.  We hope to entertain you when you visit California."

When you come here, just make sure you get all of the neccessary info in advance from airbnb. The aparment was clean and well-kept and communication with Tara was easy and quick. She let us check out pretty late (3pm), which we really really appreciated! The only thing we didn't love about the place was that there sometimes was a bit of an odor coming out of the bathroom.. I'm pretty sure that isn't Tara's fault either though, it must be a problem with old plumbing.

Although I was quite confident from their profile before my arrival, the quality of my stay was even beyond my high expectations. Aurora and Alberto confirmed they are the ideal hosts, and their house and garden were the ideal place to stay. I arrived with an empty stomach, and Aurora took me to one of the neighborhood restaurants and explained the menu in English (6 Euros for everything). After lunch, Alberto showed me all flowers and trees in the garden and later he had set up the hammock between the trees. I relaxed myself in the peaceful atmosphere with birds chirping among the fragrant orange and jasmine blossoms. During the stay, my friend, Emma and I received more than what we needed: beautifully decorated room and bathroom, delicious daily breakfast (sometimes in their lovely garden), good recommendations for restaurants and 1 day trips to nearby towns (they had prepared to give us all the information we need before we arrived). They learned my precise breakfast request in one day and prepared perfectly for the rest of my 11 day-stay. Also we enjoyed their yoga classes in the studio which is located in the basement with the window opening out to the garden. They sometimes offered me the fresh vegetable-and-fruit juice and yummy soup (They are vegetarians). On Sunday, when they have no classes, they offered us to drive around town. The highlight of the tour was the museum which also has a huge garden. Alberto knows all the flowers and plants, and has a lot of stories about almost everything. I shared their tastes and felt they were my friends for years. I totally recommend this place and will come back in the near future for a longer stay. Machiko"

It was walking distance to the very popular breakfast spot \"The Gazebo\" and to the Napili Bay that is very beautiful and you can see turtles.

You can drive elsewhere on Maui within 3.5-4 hours (one way).\n____________________________________________________________________\nFacilities/Equipment:\nIt really looks recently renovated, all facilities and equipment are good. There is a fridge, microwave and regular oven, plates and silverware. We enjoyed having breakfast on Patio with a nice garden view. Parking lots are not the issue - you just need to fill the form and submit it to management office.\n____________________________________________________________________\nCleanliness:\nThe place was clean as expected.

Perfect getaway for a couple or small family."

We also used the BBQ every night and the pool. And the king size bed was a great bonus. We recommend this place !"
